Laboratory results show the following: hematocrit 38%, platelets 250,000/\u03bcL, INR 1.2, albumin 4.2 g/dL, alanine aminotransferase 32 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase 35 U/L, total bilirubin 1.2 mg/dL, creatinine 1.0 mg/dL, ammonia 440 \u03bcg/dL, sodium 132 mEq/L, potassium 4.0 mEq/L, bicarbonate 18 mEq/L. Toxicology screen is negative. Head CT without contrast shows diffuse cerebral edema. Doppler ultrasonography of the liver is normal. She is started on lactulose, rifaximin, and dialysis. Serum ammonia level continues to be high. Further testing shows elevated urine orotic acid, elevated serum glutamine, a low citrulline level, and a normal arginine level. Which of the following treatments might help decrease her cerebral edema?",

        "rationale": "Urea cycle disorders (UCDs) secondary to enzyme defects include carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1, ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC), argininosuccinate synthetase, argininosuccinate lyase, and arginase 1 deficiencies. The most common UCD in adults is OTC deficiency, an X-linked disease. Female heterozygotes may not develop the condition until they are adults. Patients present with hyperammonemia, typically when they are exposed to precipitants such as increased protein intake, drugs, or infection. In adults, UCD diagnosis should especially be sought after refractory hyperammonemia with no acidosis, after excluding common etiologies. In suspected UCDs, serum glutamine, citrulline, and urine orotic acid should be checked. In OTC deficiency there is increased glutamine level, low citrulline level, and increased urine orotic acid level. A combined preparation of sodium phenylacetate/sodium benzoate is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of hyperammonemic crisis in patients with inborn errors of metabolism. Arterial ammonia level greater than 200 \u03bcg/dL is strongly associated with cerebral edema and cerebral herniation. Decreasing the ammonia levels will help with decreasing the cerebral edema and intracranial pressure. Oral vancomycin can be used for the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy. The patient has hyperammonemia from UCD and is already on lactulose and rifaximin. She would benefit more from sodium benzoate to increase the urea clearance and decrease the ammonia. Sodium polystyrene sulfonate is useful for treating hyperkalemia, and a protein-rich diet would worsen the hyperammonemia. References: 1. Clay AS, Hainline BE. Hyperammonemia in the ICU.

        "rationale": "This patient has thyroid storm. While diagnostic criteria remain controversial, her history of Graves diseases, combined with the clinical features, is strongly suggestive, and treatment should be initiated immediately, even before laboratory results are available. Treatment involves several components: 1) Inhibition of new hormone synthesis with propylthiouracil (PTUs) or imidazoles (methimazole and carbimazole). PTU blocks the enzyme thyroidal peroxidase to inhibit thyroid hormone synthesis. It is generally preferred over methimazole because it also inhibits the peripheral conversion of thyroxine to triiodothyronine. The dosage of PTU is a 500-1000 mg loading dose, followed by 250 mg every four hours. Methimazole is dosed 60-80 mg/day in divided doses. 2) Blockade of release with iodine or lithium. Blocking release of thyroid hormone is best accomplished with iodine, but lithium can be used in iodine-allergic patients. It is important not to administer iodine until after the synthetic pathways have been blocked with PTU (at least 30 minutes); otherwise administration of iodine might cause more thyroid hormone to be formed. Options B, C, and D each have iodine being given before PTU, which make them incorrect. 3) Inhibition of peripheral effects with beta-adrenergic agents. Propranolol is the preferred treatment to block peripheral effects of thyroid hormone because of its nonselective effects and the additional benefit of inhibiting peripheral conversion of thyroxine to triiodothyronine. If a contraindication to propranolol exists (eg, asthma, congestive heart failure), then an agent such as diltiazem could be considered. Furthermore, possible inciting events should be addressed (eg, infection, diabetic ketoacidosis, trauma, etc.). Administration of glucocorticoids is recommended because thyroid storm can precipitate adrenal crisis (relative adrenal insufficiency), with similar dosing regimens. Dexamethasone may be preferred, since it also blocks the peripheral conversion of thyroxine to triiodothyronine. Antipyretics and external cooling methods may be considered, but salicylates should be avoided because they may increase free hormone levels. Most patients will benefit from IV fluids to replace significant volume loss from hyperthermia and gastrointestinal losses. 4) Inhibition of enterohepatic circulation of thyroid hormone, which is metabolized in the liver where it is conjugated to glucuronides and sulfates and excreted into the intestine in bile, while unconjugated free hormones are reabsorbed into circulation. Cholestyramine, by binding conjugated products, promotes their excretion, thereby lowering thyroid hormone levels. The recommended dose is 1-4 g twice daily. Reference: 1. Asare K.

        "correct_answer": "D",
        "rationale": "Posttraumatic rhabdomyolysis is common and associated with significant morbidity and mortality. In earthquake survivors, it is the second most important cause of mortality. Nontraumatic causes of rhabdomyolysis include extreme exertion, grand mal seizures, delirium, drugs, toxins, infections, and endocrine disorders. Prolonged anesthetics can be associated with rhabdomyolysis, especially in young muscular patients. A common feature of both traumatic and nontraumatic rhabdomyolysis is massive necrosis resulting in limb weakness, myalgia, and gross pigmenturia. The pathophysiologic process involves sarcolemmic injury as well as depletion of ATP within the myocyte. This leads to a detrimental increase in intracellular calcium. Tight calcium regulation is necessary in order to ensure proper contractile function (low concentrations at rest and increasing concentrations during a state of activation facilitate proper actin myosin-binding and contraction). Channels and pumps that regulate this calcium concentration are ATP dependent and, once ATP depletion occurs, are no longer able to maintain calcium homeostasis. The muscle persistently contracts, and calcium-dependent proteases and phospholipases are activated, eventually leading to destruction of the myocyte. Kidney injury commonly results as a consequence of renal vasoconstriction, direct and ischemic tubule injury, and tubular obstruction. After identification and treatment of the cause of rhabdomyolysis, the important steps to prevent acute kidney injury include aggressive volume administration with the goal of maintaining and enhancing renal perfusion to minimize cast formation and/or to flush out casts that have already formed. Another goal is enhancement of urinary potassium excretion, since death from hyperkalemia is a major complication of traumatic rhabdomyolysis. Although the optimal type of fluid and rate of repletion is unclear, potassium-containing fluids should be avoided, especially in the initial phase, and administration of normal saline at 1-2 L/hr is generally recommended initially. Despite the theoretical benefits of bicarbonate administration (prevention of nephrotoxic effects of myoglobinuria such as heme protein precipitation with Tamm- Horsfall protein, decrease of release of free iron from myoglobin and prevention of formation of uric acid crystals), the administration of bicarbonate plus mannitol over normal saline alone has not been shown to prevent renal failure, reduce the need for dialysis or prevent death in trauma patients. There was, however, a trend towards better outcome in patients with CK values over 30,000 U/L. The use of loop diuretics remains controversial. No study has shown a clear benefit to patients with rhabdomyolysis. The use of loop diuretics therefore is recommended in the same manner as that for acute kidney injury that is due to other causes.

His medical history is significant for hypertension treated with lisinopril, congestive heart failure, for which he takes furosemide, 20 mg twice daily, and diabetes mellitus that is controlleld with metformin. He is currently on continuous infusions of dopamine, 3 \u03bcg/kg/min, and nitroglycerine, 20 \u03bcg/min. Which of the following medications will lead to the greatest increase in glomerular filtration rate by its effects on renal plasma flow?",
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "rationale": "Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is the total amount of plasma filtered at the glomerulus. Inulin is used to estimate GFR because it is freely filterable and not secreted or absorbed by the kidneys. Creatinine can be used as an approximation but is both filtered and secreted. Renal plasma flow is the amount of plasma that flows through the kidneys per unit of time. This is difficult to measure and is instead estimated from the effective renal plasma flow (ERPF), which is the amount of plasma cleared of para-aminohippuric acid (PAH) per unit time. PAH is primarily secreted rather than filtered, but can be used to estimate ERPF. At a level of 3 \u03bcg/kg/min, dopamine theoretically acts solely on the D1 receptor, causing dilation of the afferent and efferent arterioles of the glomerulus, leading to increased renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rate. Dose response studies demonstrated that the dopamine-induced increase in ERPF reaches its maximum at 3 mcg/kg/min. The increase in ERPF remained unchanged by pretreatment with metoprolol, and a comparison of dopamine and dobutamine in doses producing similar increases in cardiac output showed that only dopamine increased ERPF. These findings indicate that indirect hemodynamic effects secondary to increases in cardiac contractility and cardiac output do not contribute significantly to the increase in renal perfusion caused by dopamine in doses lower than 3 mcg/kg/min. It is important to note that, despite this mechanism of action, dopamine has not been shown to prevent renal failure. Furosemide is a loop diuretic that acts in the ascending limb of the loop of Henle. It inhibits the cotransport of sodium, potassium and chloride out of the nephron, making the ultrafiltrate more tonic and leading to a less hypertonic interstitium. With a less hypertonic interstitium, free water is retained in the collecting duct and thus excreted. Furosemide does not affect filtration at the glomerulus by direct effects on renal plasma flow. Lisinopril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI). Normally, in the setting of sympathetic stimulation or decreased afferent blood flow, the renin-angiotensinaldosterone system (RAAS) is activated, leading to increased release of angiotensin II, which acts both to increase aldosterone secretion from the adrenal cortex and directly causes constriction of the efferent arteriole to decrease ERPF and increase GFR. By inhibiting the formation of angiotensin II, ACEIs prevent efferent arteriolar constriction and therefore decrease GFR. Metformin has no appreciable affects on ERPF or GFR. References: 1. Olsen NV.

        "rationale": "Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) is a well-described entity in patients with end-stage liver disease, and is believed to be caused mainly by functional factors. HRS type 1 is characterized by a rapid decline of renal function over a period of several weeks whereas HRS type 2 is considered to be a more chronic disease. Pathophysiology is mostly believed to be due to arterial vasodilation with reduced systemic vascular resistance and cardiac output that cannot compensate for this vasodilation. Secondary phenomenon is activation of the renal angiotensin-aldosterone system and increase secretion of arginine vasopressin to maintain blood pressure. The problem is multifactorial, and lately an increase in an inflammatory state has been described as yet another factor potentiating this problem. The treatment of HRS is in part preventive, by administration of concentrated albumin and treatment of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, so D is the correct answer. In some patients dual transplant of liver and kidney can be considered but this is a controversial issue since we cannot predict which patients will recover their kidney function after liver transplant.

IV calcium gluconate is the therapy of choice in patients with ECG changes secondary to hyperkalemia to stabilize the cardiac membrane against the hyperkalemia-induced depolarization of resting cardiac membrane potential. It has no direct effect in lowering serum potassium. Finally, treatment with glucose and insulin lowers serum potassium within minutes. IV insulin promotes potassium uptake intracellularly by enhancing the sodium-potassium- ATPase transporter. Onset of insulin action occurs within 10 to 20 minutes and peaks at 30 to 60 minutes. The duration of insulin in the setting of normal creatinine clearance is between 4 to 6 hours. The range of potassium lowering after insulin and glucose therapy is between 0.5 to 1.2 meq/L.

This combination is often seen in patients with alcohol abuse who binge drink and are concurrently malnourished due to excessive alcohol intake and/or gastritis leading to food intolerance. The elevated anion gap is a result of ketone body production due to suppressed insulin secretion and lipolysis, due in part to the alcohol metabolism and starvation state. In addition, a mild lactic acidosis is present due to volume depletion or possibly early sepsis secondary to aspiration pneumonia. Distinguishing toxic alcohol ingestions, such as from ethylene glycol and isopropanol, from alcoholic ketoacidosis is challenging, and may not be feasible in the acute setting. Often empiric treatment with fomepizole may be needed until further laboratory testing can be conducted. History is usually the most important clue in suspecting toxic alcohol ingestion, in addition to detecting an anion gap acidosis with an elevated osmolar gap. Relying exclusively on an elevated anion gap and osmolar gap is ill advised, however, since there are many instances in which this will not hold true. Isopropyl alcohol ingestion does not cause acidosis and can be eliminated from the differential diagnosis.

        "rationale": "The patient has acute severe hyponatremia in the setting of transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) syndrome, which develops from bladder perforation with subsequent absorption of large amount of irrigation fluids (typically glycine, sorbitol, or free water) that results in circulatory overload, hemolysis, hyponatremia, and acute renal failure. Small subclinical perforations can occur in more than 50% of patients. The hallmarks of TURBT syndrome are acute hyponatremia, hemolysis, and metabolic acidosis. Absorption of large amounts of hypotonic fluid leads to significant plasma hypotonicity and hyponatremia. The central nervous system and brain are most susceptible to devastating changes secondary to acute hyponatremia. A rapid drop in plasma sodium concentration leads to brain swelling, increase in intracranial pressure, and potential herniation. In response to hypotonicity, astrocytes activate cell-to-cell transfer of taurine (organic osmolyte) that protects neurons from swelling at the expense of astrocytes swelling. Within 24 to 48 hours, astrocytes normalize in volume due to slow loss of taurine and glutamate. In addition to loss of organic osmolytes, the downregulation of osmolyte-accumulating transporters (taurine and myo-inositol transporters) takes place. As results of these changes, astrocytes are extremely susceptible to hypertonic injury in cases of rapid correction of hyponatremia. Hypertonic injury triggers apoptosis, disruption of the blood-brain barrier, and demyelination. Demyelination syndrome manifests as altered mental status, seizure and movement disorders, and behavioral abnormalities. Central pontine dimyelination presents with locked-in syndrome. It is very important to distinguish the chronicity of hyponatremia. Fast correction of chronic hypernatremia (greater than 24-48 hours in duration) will lead to hypertonic injury of astrocytes, since their osmolar adjustment mechanism are exhausted. In the setting of acute (less than 24 hours in duration) and severe symptomatic hyponatremia, aggressive correction of hyponatremia is necessary to prevent fatal cerebral edema, and will not cause demyelinating injury. In the case of acute severe hyponatremia, administration of several boluses (1-2 mL/kg) of 3% sodium chloride is indicated with the goal of raising the sodium concentration by 4 to 6 mEq/L in the first 6 hours. This approach hastens the development of acute cerebral edema. Correction of chronic hyponatremia should not exceed 8 mEq/L/day to prevent the development of demyelination. Fluid restriction is not suitable for patients with acute severe symptomatic hyponatremia. Desmopressin leads to increased reabsorption of free water and decrease of free water loss with urine.

The ischemic cells have released potassium to the extracellular space concomitantly with an underlying severe metabolic acidosis. Although metabolic acidosis has repeatedly been implicated as a causative factor of hyperkalemia via transcellular shift of potassium from the intracellular to extracellular compartment, this paradigm has been challenged. The significant elevation of potassium is secondary to reperfusion distal to the celiac artery, which explains the occurrence of a wide complex arrhythmia, peak T waves/ST elevations, and eventually asystole. An acute coronary syndrome could have explained some of the ECG changes since most vascular patients have undetected coronary artery disease. A retrograde dissection of the aorta compromising the ascending segment, even when possible, is not a frequent presentation for a type B dissection; however, many investigators have reported the transformation to type A dissection after stent graft placement for type B dissection with an estimated rate of 2%.

Traditionally, the Starling principle has been taught as a model of semipermeable capillaries subject to hydrostatic and oncotic pressure gradients. This model employed the classic compartments of plasma, interstitial, and intracellular as locations where resuscitative fluids would filter, depending on the balance between hydrostatic and oncotic pressure gradients. Recent research has shown that the endothelial glycocalyx layer appears to have a major role in fluid exchange and volume of distribution. The glycocalyx model, an acellular layer lining the endothelium, is a paradigm shift in our understanding of the interface between the blood and the endothelial cells. It is a key determinant of vascular permeability. The glycocalyx layer has varying membrane permeability across organ systems, which changes based on timing and severity of the ongoing disease process, as well as treatment. Extravasation of fluid from the capillaries is predominately dependent on capillary hydrostatic pressure and not on decreased intravascular colloid osmotic pressure, as once thought. Various disease states (ie, sepsis and trauma) as well as over-resuscitation (leading to the release of atrial natriuretic peptide) can damage the glycocalyx layer. References: 1.

There is an underlying metabolic alkalosis from vomiting and nasogastric tube drainage. The respiratory alkalosis develops with her abdominal pain and she becomes tachypneic. Discerning acid-base problems requires a systematic approach. Here is one of several methods that can be used. Step 1: Look at the pH.

This patient\u2019s pH is 7.50, with a partial pressure of carbon dioxide of 24 mm Hg, consistent with acute respiratory alkalosis. Step 2: Calculate the anion gap. The body will never generate a large anion gap to compensate for the primary disorder. In this case the anion gap is 27 mEq/L. Of note, the albumin level is normal, but if less than 4.0 g/dL, the anion gap would require correction by 2.5 mEq/L for every 1 below 4.0 g/dL. Step 3: Calculate the delta-delta gap to see if there is an underlying non-anion gap acidosis or metabolic alkalosis in addition to the anion gap acidosis.

Shortly after admission, arterial blood gas analysis reveals pH 7.12, partial arterial carbon dioxide pressure 40 mm Hg, bicarbonate 17 mEq/L. Chemistry results are: sodium 145 mEq/L, potassium 3.1 mEq/L, chloride 95 mEq/L, bicarbonate 17 mEq/L, blood urea nitrogen 25 mg/dL, creatinine 1.65 mg/dL, albumin 2.5 g/dL. Which of the following scenarios best fits these laboratory findings?",
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "rationale": "When solving acid/base problems, the first step is examining the pH. A normal pH is between 7.35 and 7.45. Acidemia is present when serum pH is less than 7.35, while alkalemia is present when serum pH is more than 7.45. In this case, the pH is 7.12, indicating academia. The second step is examining the partial arterial carbon dioxide pressure (Paco2) to determine whether the academia is respiratory in nature or not. A normal Paco2 is 35- 45 mm Hg. In this case, the Paco2 is 40 mm Hg, indicating that the low pH is due to a metabolic, rather than respiratory, component. This is further validated by the low bicarbonate level (17 mEq/L). The third step is to see whether or not there is respiratory compensation. With a metabolic acidosis, the body attempts to compensate by hyperventilating in order to remove carbon dioxide. In this case, the Paco2 is 40 mm Hg. In order to be appropriately compensated, for every 1 mEq/L decrease in bicarbonate from 24 mEq/L, the Paco2 should decrease by 1 mm Hg from 40 mm Hg. In this case, the bicarbonate decreases by 7 mEq/L (from 24 mEq/L to 17 mEq/L) but the Paco2 does not decrease at all from 40 mm Hg. Alternatively, the Winters formula can be used to predict the appropriate Paco2 for a given bicarbonate. The Winters formula is Paco2 = (1.5 x bicarbonate) + 8 \u00b1 2. For the given question, the expected Paco2 would be 33 \u00b1 2 mm Hg. The actual Paco2 is 40 mm Hg, which is too high given the level of acidosis; therefore, a concomitant respiratory acidosis is present. When dealing with a metabolic acidosis, it is imperative to next calculate the anion gap using the anion gap formula: Anion gap = sodium - (bicarbonate + chloride); normal 10-12. In this case, the anion gap is 33 so an anion gap metabolic acidosis must be present. Finally one must determine if there is a mixed picture present. In order to determine this, the delta anion gap must be calculated: Delta anion gap = (anion gap - 12)/(24 - bicarbonate). In this case, the delta anion gap is 3: (33-12 )/(24-17) = 3. Delta ratio assessment guidelines specify that a value less than 0.4 = hyperchloremic normal anion gap acidosis. If 0.4-0.8, consider combined high anion gap and normal anion gap acidosis but note that the ratio is often less than 1 in acidosis associated with renal failure. A value of 1-2 is usual for uncomplicated high anion gap acidosis. Lactic acidosis yields an average value of 1.6. Diabetic ketoacidosis is more likely to yield a ratio closer to 1 due to urine ketone loss (especially if the patient is not dehydrated). A value of greater than 2 suggests a preexisting elevated bicarbonate level. Consider a concurrent metabolic alkalosis or a preexisting compensated respiratory acidosis. Since this value is greater than 2, a concomitant metabolic alkalosis is also present. The bicarbonate is too high given the current anion gap. In this case, the patient was admitted for nausea and vomiting, which could lead to a mixed picture, including a metabolic alkalosis. Other potential causes of metabolic alkalosis include iatrogenic administration of bicarbonate or excessive diuretic use. It is also important to note how hypoalbuminemia can affect acid/base status. Since albumin is a negatively charged anion that greatly contributes to the anion gap, when albumin levels are decreased, the anion gap may be falsely decreased. It is important then to be aware of the albumin corrected anion gap: Albumin corrected anion gap = observed anion gap + 2.5 (normal albumin-observed albumin) where the normal albumin is 4 g/dL. In this case, the albumin corrected anion gap = 33 + 2.5 (4-2.5) = 36.75. References: 1. Matthes K, Urman R, Ehrenfeld J, eds.

Most patients will have a profound metabolic acidosis (as severe as arterial pH < 7.0) with attempted respiratory compensation. Patients in status epilepticus continue to breathe with appropriate gas exchange as long as the airway remains clear. This metabolic acidosis will correct itself once the seizures are controlled. Antiseizure drugs with sedating side effects can impede the drive for respiratory compensation, creating a secondary acid-base disturbance (worsening the overall acidosis) with a respiratory acidosis. This respiratory compensation is of paramount importance as a patient is placed on the ventilator, and clinicians should plan on a high minute ventilation requirement. This patient has no oxygenation issues, and increasing positive end-expiratory pressure is not the correct intervention for increasing ventilation. Propofol is a sedating medication that usually impedes respiratory drive, leading to an increase in carbon dioxide levels. Decreasing the set respiratory rate could worsen respiratory acidosis, negatively impacting the clinical situation. Dead space is calculated from correlating the measured expiatory carbon dioxide and the blood gas measurement that is still pending; however, this end-tidal carbon dioxide value is not consistent with a dead space issue.

Her boyfriend denies that she had any cold-like symptoms during the past week. She is allergic to nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and takes an over-the-counter medication daily for severe headaches. Her boyfriend says that she has been extremely depressed since the death of her child. She drinks six cans of beer daily and occasionally injects heroin. Two doses of naloxone are administered, but she remains obtunded. Laboratory results reveal white blood cell count 20,500/\u03bcL, hemoglobin 12.1 g/dL, glucose 134 mg/dL, sodium 145 mEq/L, potassium 4.0 mEq/L, chloride 106 mEq/L, carbon dioxide 4 mEq/L, blood urea nitrogen 20 mg/dL, creatinine 2.36 mg/dL, AST 160 U/L, ALT 200 U/L, alkaline phosphate 20 U/L, troponin 0.01 ng/ml. Arterial blood gas analysis reveals: pH 7.14, carbon dioxide 18 mm Hg, partial pressure of oxygen 106 mm Hg, bicarbonate 10 mEq/L, lactate 1 mmol/L, ethanol less than 5, acetylsalicylic acid negative.

        "correct_answer": "C",
        "rationale": "This patient has elevated anion gap metabolic acidosis, which is often caused by methanol, ethanol, uremia, diabetic ketoacidosis, propylene glycol, oxoproline, lactate, or salicylates. A normal anion gap ranges from 8 to 16 mEq/L, with a value over 16 mEq/L considered an elevated anion gap. In this case, the anion gap is calculated to be 35 mEq/L (145 - (106 + 4)). The patient is nonadherent with her insulin, but her blood glucose on arrival is 134, making diabetic ketoacidosis less likely. Intoxication from vast quantities of ethanol is similarly unlikely since her ethanol level was less than 5 on admission. Salicylates such as aspirin can cause an elevated anion gap metabolic acidosis and a respiratory alkalosis, but her aspirin level is negative and she has a compensated metabolic acidosis. Acetaminophen overdose is the most common cause of acute liver failure in the United States. Signs and symptoms of an overdose include nausea, vomiting, sweating, lethargy, and elevated liver enzymes. Aside from causing an elevation in liver enzymes, ingesting a large quantity of acetaminophen also causes an elevation in 5- oxoproline. 5-Oxoproline is a metabolite of acetaminophen, and if it accumulates in the body it can cause an elevated anion gap metabolic acidosis. 5-Oxoproline is an intermediate in the gamma-glutamyl pathway, which is the metabolic cycle responsible for creating glutathione and pushing amino acids into the cytosol. When glutathione levels are diminished, feedback inhibition ceases, causing an overproduction of gamma-glutamylcysteine, which is then metabolized to 5-oxoproline. Treatment with N-acetylcysteine should be initiated and referral to a liver transplant center should be considered. References: 1. Pitt JJ, Hauser S.

This young, relatively healthy patient is found to have hypercalcemia, along with renal dysfunction. In this setting, the clinician must be concerned about hyperparathyroidism, with a main goal of restoring her volume status. IV resuscitation in the acute setting would have the most benefit for the patient because she is probably dehydrated from hypercalcemia-induced urinary salt wasting. Calcimimetic agents, such as cincalcet, reduce calcium levels by activating the calcium-sensing receptor in the parathyroid gland, thereby inhibiting parathyroid hormone secretion. They have shown clinical benefit in secondary hyperparathyroidism associated with renal failure and in parathyroid carcinoma. Glucocorticoids, such as prednisone, reduce serum calcium concentrations by decreasing calcitriol production by activated mononuclear cells. Clinical studies have shown the most benefit in hypercalcemia secondary to granulomatous disease; they take effect in two days. Bisphosphonates, such as zoledronate, act by inhibiting calcium release by interfering with osteoclast-mediated bone resorption, and have shown clinical benefit in hypercalcemia secondary to malignancy. Although bisphosphonates may be used in conjunction with isotonic solution, their maximal effect usually takes two to four days. References: 1.

This patient had undiagnosed hyperthyroidism as evidenced by her preoperative weakness, fatigue, and palpitations. She subsequently developed appendicitis, and the stress of the infection as well as the surgery, sent her into thyroid storm. Thyroid storm is a rare but potentially life threatening complication of hyperthyroidism that is often triggered by a stress to the body, such as infection. Symptoms include high fever, tachycardia, mental status changes, gastrointestinal symptoms, and potentially high-output heart failure. Treatment must be immediately initiated, often before laboratory results are available, to achieve the best outcome. IV betablockers, such as propranolol, are effective for rate control and help block peripheral thyroxine to triiodothyronine conversion. Antithyroid drugs such as propylthiouracil and methimazole are also needed to block production of thyroid hormone. Steroids are given to protect against concomitant adrenal insufficiency and prevent peripheral thyroid conversion. Iodine may be added only after antithyroid drugs are started. Malignant hyperthermia and serotonin syndrome may look similar to thyroid storm, but there are some subtle differences. In malignant hyperthermia, a more rapid onset after induction might be expected as well as muscle rigidity and respiratory acidosis. Serotonin syndrome is also associated with muscle rigidity and often clonus. The hypertension can be controlled with the IV ACE inhibitor enalaprilat, but the intitial treatment of her thyroid storm will treat the underlying cause of her increased blood pressure.

As a result, despite appropriate fluid resuscitation, antibiotics, and vasopressor support, she remained in refractory shock requiring IV stress-dose steroids to support her blood pressure. CIRCI is a form of relative adrenal insufficiency in which blood corticosteroid levels are inadequate for the stress imparted during critical illness. Features include refractory shock as well as electrolyte abnormalities including hypoglycemia, hyperkalemia, and hyponatremia. The diagnosis is often challenging based on laboratory test parameters, with no agreed-upon values in the literature. Conflicting results from trials such as Annane\u2019s and the CORTICUS study (albeit with different patient populations) have led to a Surviving Sepsis Guideline recommendation to treat CIRCI on clinical grounds alone, if it is suspected. Exact dosing and duration of steroids is undefined, but lower, intermittent dosing of IV hydrocortisone is often used and weaned once shock is resolved. Adding antifungal coverage could be considered, although it is less likely to be of benefit in this scenario.

        "rationale": "Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) describes the physiologic disturbances that can occur after initiation of cancer treatment. Spontaneous cases of TLS may also occur. The potential to develop TLS exists with any cancer, but is more common with hematologic malignancies or when a large cancer burden is present. In TLS, rapid cancer cell lysis releases intracellular contents and metabolites (potassium, phosphate, purines, and cytokines) beyond the body\u2019s ability to manage, leading to hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, and hyperuricemia. Signs and symptoms may develop at any time, but commonly within the first few days of starting cytotoxic medication. Examples include nausea, emesis, cramps, tetany, or seizures due to hypocalcemia. Cardiac dysrhythmias may occur due to hyperkalemia and hypocalcemia. Uremia can lead to metallic taste, pruritus, restless legs, ecchymoses or pericarditis. Hypotension and inflammation may occur with release of cytokines. Acute kidney injury can develop as a result of the precipitation of uric acid crystals and calcium phosphate crystals, and can be exacerbated by dehydration and acidosis. Uric acid is a product of the metabolic breakdown of purine nucleotides, the building blocks of DNA and RNA. After cell lysis, enzymes break down DNA and RNA, leading to the release of purines, which are then broken down to hypoxanthine through purine catabolism. The enzyme xanthine oxidase catalyzes the formation of uric acid from xanthine and hypoxanthine. Uric acid is excreted in the urine, but higher levels lead to precipitation and crystal-induced nephropathy. Urate oxidase is an enzyme that does not exist in humans, but exists in other animals, and is used as a therapeutic drug target to further break down uric acid into the water-soluble molecule allantoin, which is excreted in the urine. Identifying patients at high risk for TLS before initiation of cancer therapy and early recognition of these metabolic complications is important. Hydration is essential to prevent hypotension and improve renal perfusion. There are two main mechanisms for treating elevated uric acid levels: xanthine oxidase inhibitors and recombinant urate oxidase. Xanthine oxidase inhibitors (allopurinol, febuxostat) prevent the formation of uric acid; however, existing uric acid still must be cleared and can take several days to improve. Furthermore, xanthine levels can increase and lead to nephropathy secondary to xanthine precipitation. Therefore, allopurinol is recommended only for patients at low risk for TLS or in combination with rasburicase. Rasburicase is a recombinant urate oxidase, converting uric acid to water-soluble allantoin, which is excreted in the urine. Because rasburicase does not increase xanthine levels and directly reduces uric acid levels, it is recommended as the first-line agent for patients at high risk for TLS. In severe situations, hemodialysis may be used. Although urinary alkalinization increases uric acid solubility, it decreases calcium phosphate solubility. Because it is more difficult to correct hyperphosphatemia than hyperuricemia, urinary alkalinization is approached with caution in TLS. Purine analogs are antimetabolites that mimic the structure of metabolic purines. They act as inhibitors of DNA synthesis and are used to treat certain cancers and autoimmune disorders. Phosphate binders are medications used to reduce the absorption of phosphate and are typically used in people with chronic kidney failure. They are taken with meals, binding to phosphate in the gastrointestinal tract and excreted, preventing phosphate absorption. References: 1. Howard SC, Jones DP, Pui CH. The tumor lysis syndrome.

        "rationale": "Carcinoids are neuroendocrine tumors that originate mainly in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and lungs. They synthesize and release a variety of bioactive substances (mainly serotonin, histamine, tachykinins, kallikreins, and prostaglandins), which are responsible for the symptoms and manifestations known as carcinoid syndrome. Most GI carcinoid tumors do not initially manifest with these symptoms, however, because their humoral substances are released into the portal circulation and inactivated by the liver. Carcinoid syndrome develops in patients with gastrointestinal carcinoid tumors that have metastasized to the liver. Once liver disease is present, the liver is unable to protect the body from the actions of these substances. The most significant long-term sequela of chronic exposure to these bioactive chemicals is carcinoid heart disease, which consists of pathognomonic plaque-like fibrous deposits on the heart valves, chambers, and intima of the great vessels. Typically only the right side of the heart is affected due to inactivation of these substances by the lungs. Surgical resection is the primary treatment for carcinoid tumors. Before resection, symptom management is controlled mainly with the somatostatin analogs, such as octreotide. Somatostatin is an endogenous peptide that inhibits the release of a broad range of hormones, including many of those released by carcinoid tumors. The majority of carcinoid tumors express somatostatin receptors and, therefore, its administration will inhibit the release of its bioactive substances. Carcinoid crisis is a life-threatening form of this syndrome that may be triggered by tumor manipulation, as in this patient. The somatostatin analogs are the primary treatment since the administration of catecholamines can worsen the situation by potentiating further hormone release from the tumors. Therefore, systemic catecholamines are recommended only in life-threatening situations or sustained vasodilatory shock following administration of a somatostatin analog. IV furosemide in the setting of hypotension is not recommended and, furthermore, the findings of jugular venous distention and right-sided regurgitant murmurs in this patient likely reflect primary valvular carcinoid heart disease rather than fluid overload. Histamine blockers will not do much to treat the hypotension in this disease, which is due not just to histamine, but to a number of substances. References: 1. Fox DJ, Khattar RS.

        "correct_answer": "B",
        "rationale": "This patient has abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) due to extensive volume resuscitation in the setting of severe burns. Bladder pressure should be urgently checked to formally diagnose this condition and expedite further management. ACS is often under-recognized in critically ill patients because organ failure is often multifactorial and attributed to the underlying disease process. When abdominal pressures are found to be greater than 20 mm Hg with associated organ failure, criteria are met for a diagnosis of ACS. Organ failure can be manifested as hypotension due to pressure on the vena cava and a decrease in venous return and subsequent drop in cardiac output. Patients on mechanical ventilation often have high peak airway pressures due to a distended abdomen. However, this patient was on pressure-control ventilation, in which airway pressures are regulated, and thus ACS manifests as a reduction in tidal volume on this mode of ventilation. Renal failure is another common finding, and thought to be secondary to decreased renal perfusion from renal vein compression and diminished cardiac output. Management is abdominal decompression. Providing more IV fluids is likely to worsen compartment pressures. With a low pulse pressure variation, it is highly unlikely that he will respond to more fluid boluses. Acute tubular necrosis from rhabdomyolysis is possible, but less likely given the time frame from the contrast bolus and the relatively low creatinine kinase level. References: 1.

Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient\u2019s renal failure?",
        "correct_answer": "D",
        "rationale": "Intra-abdominal hypertension is defined as intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) of greater than 10 mm Hg. Abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) is the effective end-organ hypoperfusion that results from prolonged intra-abdominal hypertension. IAP higher than 20 to 25 mm Hg may cause ACS and, in this way, acute functional loss of various abdominal and extra-abdominal organs. Inflammatory and hemodynamic factors caused by intra-abdominal hypertension may affect pelvic, thoracic, cranial and muscular areas beside abdominal organs. Urinary bladder pressure is the gold standard for measuring IAP and is valid up to an IAP of 70 mm Hg. Factors affecting its reliability include pregnancy, obesity, and ascites. Option A is incorrect because the patient has remained normotensive throughout his hospitalization and we can assume that after 7 liters of crystalloid, he is close to intravascularly replete. Furthermore, administration of IV fluids in this situation is be appropriate given the evidence of increased abdominal pressures. Oliguria progressing to anuria, and prerenal azotemia unresponsive to volume expansion characterize the renal dysfunction of ACS. Ureteral compression by increased IAP was felt to at one time be the cause of renal failure in ACS but this has since been disproven because ureteral stents do not prevent the development of renal failure in this setting. In 1947, studies examined subjects undergoing external compression to 20 mm Hg. In these models, measurements of renal vein pressure, inferior vena cava pressure, renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rate were studied. The effective renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rate dropped by 24.4% and 27.5%, respectively. All patients became oliguric and the absence of a sudden increase in urine flow on release of pressure suggested that ureteral compression was unlikely to be the cause of oliguria. Instead, it was discovered that elevations in renal vein pressure was probably the culprit, making option D the correct answer. Intra-abdominal hypertension causing venous congestion and decreased preload can certainly impact cardiac output, especially when pressures enter the range to cause ACS; however, this is not felt to be the primary cause of renal failure because correcting cardiac output with fluid and inotropes has not shown to be of benefit in this instance. It is important to note that, when fluid is administered, it should be done through an internal jugular vein rather than a femoral line given the likely impedement in venous return below the diaphragm.

While this is a transient effect, the acidosis has been associated with immune suppression and coagulopathy.

High-chloride loads have also been associated with increased renal replacement therapy requirements.

Which of the following is the best predictor of daily energy needs for this patient?",
        "correct_answer": "A",
        "rationale": "The metabolic response of critical illness is characterized by an increase in resting energy expenditure (REE). Energy needs of the critically ill patient are dynamic, changing throughout the ICU stay. Nutrition may affect clinical outcomes in critically ill patients, and providing either fewer or more calories than the patient needs can adversely affect outcomes. It is therefore essential to have a precise measurements of energy needs in these patients in order to avoid underfeeding and overfeeding, loss of critical lean body mass, and worsening of any existing nutrient deficiencies. In clinical practice, energy needs are determined either by using predictive equations (eg, Harris-Benedict) or by actual measurement using indirect calorimetry (IC). Although many equations exist for predicting resting energy expenditure, most studies have reached the conclusion that current predictive equations do not accurately predict required energy needs in the critically ill population. The epidemic of obesity further renders the calculations of requirements by predictive equations increasingly inaccurate at extremes of body mass index. The IC technique most accurately reflects the exact rate of energy production and substrate oxidation in critically ill patients in the clinical practice setting. IC calculates REE by measuring whole-body oxygen and carbon dioxide gas exchange. This concept is based on the strong correlation between intake of oxygen and release of carbon dioxide with energy production. It is estimated that approximately 80% of energy expenditure is due to oxygen consumption, and the remaining 20% is due to carbon dioxide production. The Nutrition Risk in Critically Ill (NUTRIC) score is a recently developed tool to help discriminate which ICU patients will benefit more (or less) from aggressive proteinenergy provision. The score, ranging from 1-10, is based on six variables (age, Acute Physiologic and Chronic Health Evaluation [APACHE] II score, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment [SOFA] score, number of comorbidities, days from hospital to ICU admission and interleukin 6 levels). Patients with a score greater than 5 are most likely to benefit from aggressive nutrition therapy. The SOFA score allows for calculation of both the amount and severity of organ dysfunction in six organ systems (respiratory, coagulatory, liver, cardiovascular, renal, and neurologic). It is used to quantify the severity of the patient\u2019s illness based on the degree of organ dysfunction serially over time. References: 1. Heyland DK, Dhaliwal R, Jiang X, Day AG.

One of the reasons for this is that most critically ill patients are in a catabolic state due to a proinflammatory state and thus have increased caloric demands.

Initiating enteral feeding compared to parenteral nutrition has also been shown to result in less infection. Multiple clinical trials have shown that gastric residual volumes are unnecessary and may contribute to malnutrition. Therefore, reducing or discontinuing enteral feeding would prevent patients from meeting their increased caloric demands No evidence exists that low-volume elemental feeding has clinical benefit compared to full enteral feeding.

This is a rapidly reversible heart failure syndrome that often mimics acute coronary syndrome and is essentially a diagnosis of exclusion. Patients often have ST elevation on ECG and elevated troponin levels and either no coronary artery disease or very minimal amounts on catheterization. Classic findings on echocardiography are apical ballooning due to hypokinesis of the apex and a hyperdynamic basal segment. The pathophysiology of the disease is thought to be excessive catecholamine stress on the heart. Treatment for patients with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is generally supportive but a minority of patients will develop hemodynamic compromise requiring further action. Although no guidelines exist, it is generally recommended to avoid giving additional catecholamines, such as dobutamine or norepinephrine, since this may worsen the condition and stress on the heart. If left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction is present, tachycardia should be avoided, since it will reduce diastolic filling time. Increased inotropic stimulation can also worsen LVOT obstruction. Phenylephrine is the vasopressor of choice, combined with beta blockade in this scenario. An intraaortic balloon pump is an option for patients in cardiogenic shock without LVOT obstruction, as well as aggressive diuresis. References: 1.

The pump speed with the programmable variable is titrated in the operating room and ICU. In the immediate postoperative period, complications include bleeding, hypovolemia, arrhythmia, thrombosis, in-flow cannula \u201csuck-down\u201d events, device malposition, and right-sided heart failure. Later complications include infection, thrombosis, and drive line/machine issues. Troubleshooting these early complications in the ICU requires a thorough review of the available hemodynamic parameters, review of the right-side heart physiology, and close evaluation of echocardiographic findings.

Systemic hypertension can exacerbate the resulting cerebral edema, so pharmacologic reduction in cerebral perfusion pressure with drugs such as labetalol is appropriate. The syndrome usually resolves within 24 hours after surgery. Treating symptoms with additional narcotics would be beneficial only if the blood pressure elevation is the result of surgical pain, which does not appear to be the case.

The device is attached in-line between the endotracheal tube and the delivery system. The chemical indicator in the device will change color depending on the CO2 concentration detected. The higher the CO2 level, the more color change will be seen from purple to yellow. In patients with profoundly low cardiac output, end-tidal CO2 levels may be significantly lowered due to diminished lung perfusion. Ventilation is directly correlated to pulmonary perfusion. A profoundly low cardiac output could cause the clinical scenario in this case. Possible additional factors are ineffective chest compressions, massive pulmonary emboli, tension pneumothorax, or some other cause of inadequate cardiac output during cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Often there will be a significant increase in end-tidal CO2 levels once return of spontaneous circulation has been achieved. Severe acidosis would not be associated with a lower level of end-tidal CO2. Venous hyperoxia has been documented in post-cardiac arrest patients after the return of spontaneous circulation. It is presumed to be secondary to bioenergetics failure and defects in oxygen utilization after a prolonged pulseless time. This does not have any impact on end-tidal CO2 detection. It would be extremely unlikely that low-level color change is due to hypoventilation after endotracheal intubation. It would be even more unlikely that the low-level color change persisted after the delivery of multiple breaths. References: 1. Jin X, Weil MH, Tang W, et al.

If there is adequate native cardiac function with concomitant respiratory failure, the mixing point of retrograde blood flow from the femoral artery can be more distal, leading to upper body hypoxemia. This can be monitored by comparing arterial blood gas analysis results from the patient\u2019s right radial artery to those from the left, as well as comparing to post-oxygenator blood gas values. Solutions to this problem can be to change the central cannulation, increase ECMO flows, or consider a change to venovenous ECMO if cardiac function is adequate. Based on the post-oxygenator blood gas values, the oxygenator is working effectively and does not need to be changed, nor does an additional one need to be added.

        "correct_answer": "A",
        "rationale": "This patient has Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome, as evidenced by the short PR interval and presence of a delta wave on the ECG. WPW is one of the preexcitation syndromes, which cause early depolarization of the ventricle through an abnormal connection between atria and ventricles called the accessory pathway. WPW syndrome is very rare, existing in only 0.1-3 per 1000, and is usually asymptomatic. Some patients, however, may experience syncope and palpitations. They are at greater risk for atrial fibrillation, which can lead to ventricular fibrillation. Patients are also at risk for circus reentrant tachycardias leading to paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia or ventricular tachycardia and also for sudden cardiac death. Treatment options for people with arrhythmias and WPW syndrome include nonpharmacologic therapies (ie, catheter ablation of the accessory pathway) and pharmacologic therapy (to slow ventricular heart rates or to prevent arrhythmias). In patients with WPW, a sinus beat originates from the sinoatrial (SA) node and goes through the accessory pathway and also through the atrioventricular (AV) node. Since the ECG is a summation of vectors seen by each lead, the result is a shorter PR interval and wider QRS than normal; we also see the characteristic delta wave. ST-T wave changes are also possible. In general, the AV node has a longer refractory time than the accessory pathway; therefore, an impulse transmitted through the accessory pathway will activate the ventricles earlier than if it had traveled through the AV node. Impulses can be transmitted in a retrograde or anterograde fashion through the accessory pathway, thus allowing for the development of circus reentrant tachycardias. Sympathetic stimulation (anxiety, hypovolemia, hypoxemia and acidosis, light planes of anesthesia) as well as drugs (pancuronium, meperidine, ketamine, ephedrine, digoxin, verapamil) and electrolyte abnormalities (potassium and calcium) can induce tachyarrythmias by increasing conduction through the accessory pathway. When atrial contraction becomes chaotic, as in atrial fibrillation (atria can produce 300 to 500 contractions per minute), the AV node will produce a narrow complex beat (irregularly irregular narrow-complex tachycardia) and the accessory pathway will produce a wide complex beat (irregularly irregular wide-complex tachycardia). P waves will not be present. WPW atrial fibrillation is the only arrhythmia in which there is irregularly irregular wide- and narrow-complex tachycardia. The combination of atrial fibrillation and WPW can be fatal because of rapid conduction of the atrial activity through the accessory pathway, resulting in rapid ventricular rates and leading to ventricular fibrillation. AV nodal blocking agents (metoprolol, diltiazem, digoxin, sotalol) should be avoided in this setting because they paradoxically increase ventricular rates since more atrial activity will pass through the fast-conducting accessory pathway and fewer through the AV node itself. Procainamide has been the traditional recommended therapy for unstable WPW. It is a class Ia antiarrythmic, which increases the refractory period and decreases conduction through the accessory pathway. Procainamide is typically infused intravenously at 20 to 50 mg/min, given while monitoring blood pressure closely every 5 to 10 minutes until the arrhythmia terminates, hypotension ensues, the QRS is prolonged by more than 50%, or a total of 17 mg/kg (1.2 g for a 70-kg (154.3-lb) patient) has been given. Even if it does not result in tachycardia termination, IV procainamide will usually slow the tachycardia rate and improve the hemodynamic state. Of course, synchronized cardioversion should be performed in patients who are hemodynamically unstable. References: 1. Mark DG, Brady WJ, Pines JM.

An oral anticoagulation is being considered, given the ongoing atrial fibrillation. Which of the following is the best risk-benefit analysis of thrombosis and bleeding?",
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "rationale": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) that occurs during critical illness presents challenges for management. Recent evidence suggests that patients in whom AF develops during acute illness (eg, sepsis) have high long-term risks for AF-associated complications, such as stroke, heart failure, and death. Therefore, all patients with AF lasting longer than 48 hours should be evaluated for anticoagulation. Decisions about appropriate thromboprophylaxis require individual assessment of stroke risk and bleeding risk on such therapy. Validated risk scoring tools have been developed for clinical use to assess the risks of bleeding and thrombosis. The CHADS2 score is a simple and popular tool to assess thrombosis risk in patients with AF. However, recent data suggests that this score fails to account for risk in several common subpopulations, including patients with peripheral vascular disease, women, and those for whom variations in thrombotic risk occur with age. To account for these limitations, the CHA2DS2-VASc score was developed and is currently recommended for use in AF risk assessment. In general, for patients who have had prior stroke, transient ischemic attack, or CHA2DS2-VASc score of 2 or higher, oral anticoagulants are recommended, such as warfarin or a direct thrombin inhibitor. The decision to anticoagulate a patient must be weighed against the risk of bleeding. The HAS-BLED score was recently developed and is recommended to assist in bleeding risk assessment. Patients with a HAS-BLED score of 3 or greater are considered to be at high risk for bleeding while undergoing anticoagulation. This patient illustrates the implications of using risk stratification tools. Her HAS-BLED score is 1 (age greater than 65 years), indicating that her risk of bleeding on anticoagulation is low. If her stroke risk were assessed with the CHADS2, her score would be 0 and she would therefore be prescribed either aspirin or no antithrombotic therapy. In contrast, on the CHA2DS2-VASc, she would score 3 (female, age 70 years, and previous myocardial infarction: 1 point each), placing her at high risk of stroke and therefore making her a candidate for oral anticoagulation therapy.

        "rationale": "The intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) is a mechanical circulatory device that has been used to support patients in cardiogenic shock from myocardial infarction, intractable ventricular arrhythmias, and acute decompensated heart failure. The timing of inflation and deflation of the IABP is crucial in facilitating hemodynamic support by increasing coronary perfusion and reducing afterload. Electrocardiography and systemic aortic pressure waveforms can be used to trigger the IABP. In a patient with sinus rhythm, the IABP is set to inflate mid-T wave and deflate at the peak of the R wave on ECG, which corresponds to the start of diastole and systole, respectively. In the aortic pressure waveform trigger mode, the balloon inflates with the dicrotic notch, which corresponds to aortic valve closure, and deflates before the systolic arterial upstroke that represents aortic valve opening. The pressure waveform depicted shows diastolic augmentation and an absence of a dicrotic notch. This indicates that the balloon is inflating early. Early balloon inflation impairs systolic function by increasing afterload and myocardial oxygen demand. References: 1. Trost JC, Hillis LD. Intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation.

        "correct_answer": "C",
        "rationale": "Resistance to loop diuretics is a common complication of chronic therapy in congestive heart failure. Furosemide effectively blunts the reabsorption of sodium and water in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, but this delivers a greater luminal sodium concentration to the distal convoluted tubule (DCT). Cells in the DCT hypertrophy in response to this increased sodium concentration, and absorb more sodium and water, which decreases the effectiveness of furosemide. Loop diuretics act at targets on the luminal side of the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle. To get to its target, furosemide must be filtered at the glomerulus and then secreted into the tubular lumen by the organic ion transporter. Blood urea nitrogen and other organic acids compete for binding sites on that transporter and make furosemide secretion less efficient. The reduction in plasma volume caused by effective diuresis results in activation of the renal-angiotensin-aldosterone system and the sympathetic nervous system. This reduces glomerular filtration rate, leads to decreased tubular flow, and increased reabsorption of sodium and water. Furosemide binding to plasma proteins increases the effectiveness of the drug because plasma binding is required for secretion into the tubular lumen. Hypoalbuminemia is common in heart failure and enhances conversion of furosemide to its inactive form. Increased plasma protein binding increases, not decreases, the effectiveness of furosemide as a loop diuretic, which is why co-administration of furosemide with albumin has been demonstrated to improve the response to diuretics in patients with cirrhosis and nephrotic syndrome.

The speed set on the device is unchanged. Repeated laboratory values demonstrate an increased serum lactate dehydrogenase, increased serum total bilirubin, and a mixed venous oxygen saturation that has decreased from 62% to 49%. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for these findings?",
        "correct_answer": "C",
        "rationale": "This patient\u2019s device has an increase in power required to drive the impeller at an unchanged speed and a reduced pulsatility index. The pulsatility index is an ongoing measure of the contribution of the patient\u2019s native left ventricular (LV) contraction to flow through the device. Impeller thrombosis obstructs optimal impeller function and increases the power required to achieve the set speed. In addition, the degree to which native LV contraction can contribute to increases in flow through the impeller is blunted by the presence of a thrombus in the blood flow path. This leads to a decrease in the pulsatility index. Increased serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and total bilirubin are consistent with red cell hemolysis, which is a hallmark of pump thrombosis. Because the impeller is less effective at generating flow, total cardiac output can decrease, which might lead to a decrease in mixed venous oxygen saturation (SmvO2). Popliteal vein thrombosis might increase LDH and total bilirubin, but it should not change the power requirement or decrease the patient\u2019s mixed venous oxygen saturation. Right ventricular failure might decrease SmvO2 and increase total bilirubin, but would not decrease pump power or increase LDH. Similarly, acute mitral regurgitation might reduce the SmvO2 and increase total bilirubin, but would not cause a change in pump power or increase LDH. The option most consistent with these findings is impeller thrombosis. Reference: 1. Bartoli, CR, Ailawadi G, Kern JA. Diagnosis, nonsurgical management, and prevention of LVAD thrombosis.

        "rationale": "The first description of a pulmonary arterial catheter (PAC) inserted without the use of fluoroscopy appeared in 1970. It has multiple ports to allow for measurement of intracardiac pressures and thermodilution cardiac output, infusion of medications, and atrial or ventricular pacing. The catheter can be placed at bedside in the ICU without fluoroscopy through a large-bore central venous introducer. The PAC\u2019s position can be identified using the characteristic waveforms as the catheter traverses through the superior vena cava, right atrium, and right ventricle into the pulmonary artery. The figure below shows the waveforms seen as the PAC traverses cardiac structures. The correlation between the right atrial, ventricular, pulmonary arterial, or pulmonary arterial occlusion pressure (also called pulmonary capillary wedge pressure) and left ventricular pressure is poor and, as such, these measurements can at best be considered surrogates. Fluctuations in intrathoracic and pericardial pressures negatively impact the utility of wedge pressure measurement as well, since left ventricular filling pressure is truly a measurement of the transmural pressure across the ventricular wall. PACs still have an important role in the managemet of pulmonary hypertension, including diagnosis and monitoring response to therapy. The Berlin criteria for acute respiratory distress syndrome no longer include PAC findings due to poor interobserver reliability in the diagnosis of noncardiogenic extravascular fluid. The use of PACs in the routine management of septic shock and traumatic brain injury is not supported by clinical trials. References: 1. Swan HJ, Ganz W, Forrester J, Marcus H, Diamond G, Chonette D.

        "correct_answer": "C",
        "rationale": "Increased evidence has shown that static markers, such as central venous pressure (CVP) and pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (PAOP), of preload responsiveness are inaccurate. A growing body of literature supports the use of dynamic markers as better indicators. These include pulse pressure variation (PPV), stroke volume variation, and passive leg raise. The passive leg-raising technique involves lowering a patient\u2019s thorax into a horizontal position and raising the legs 45 degrees in the air for 30 to 90 seconds. Passive leg raise is equivalent to a 150- to 300-mL IV bolus. Venous blood from the legs flows into the thorax, leading to an increase in preload and a subsequent increase in stroke volume, if the patient is volume responsive. This method of assessing volume responsiveness is accurate in patients who are spontaneously breathing, mechanically ventilated, and who have cardiac arrhythmia, provided they are monitored with a cardiac output monitoring device to assess stroke volume. Devices that have been used are pulse contour continuous cardiac output, Vigileo/FloTrac, esophageal Doppler, and echocardiography. PPV would be inaccurate in this patient because she is spontaneously breathing over the ventilator and her tidal volume is less than 8 mL/kg of IBW. PPV relies on heart and lung interactions, which are not constant in this patient. CVP due to the changes in venous tone, intrathoracic pressures, and heart compliance leads to a poor relationship between CVP and right ventricular end-diastolic volume in the critically ill patient. Numerous studies have demonstrated a poor relationship between CVP and the change in CVP in demonstrating fluid responsiveness. Similar results have been shown for PAOP. References: 1.

Disadvantages include operator dependency and the need for significant training, since under- or overestimation of findings can lead to erroneous therapy. In this patient, the echocardiographic findings speak against heart failure in that he has preserved contractility. Infection is unlikely, given the clinical scenario. His hemodynamic picture and echocardiographic findings suggest hypovolemia. Possible sources of bleeding, given the normal focused assessment with sonography in trauma examination and chest radiograph, include retroperitoneal hematoma or blood loss from long bone fracture.

        "rationale": "Central venous pressure (CVP) is an accurate reflection of right atrial pressure, which is the back pressure for venous return. Right atrial pressure is typically kept low, so venous return is unimpeded. As such, cardiac dysfunction is typically reflected by an elevation in CVP. CVP is a reflection of right-sided filling pressures; therefore, processes that affect right-sided cardiac function can elevate this hemodynamic parameter. These include pulmonary hypertension, right ventricular dysfunction, and tricuspid regurgitation. The absolute values of central venous oxygen saturation are not identical to true mixed venous oxygen saturation and are typically higher during shock states. However, as hemodynamics change, the trend in these two parameters follow the same pattern. Analysis of CVP waveforms can provide useful insight into hemodynamics. For example, a large v wave indicates tricuspid regurgitation, and a large y descent indicates restrictive cardiac dysfunction. However, there is currently significant debate as to the utility of CVP monitoring, especially with respect to fluid status. References: 1. Mark JB. Atlas of Cardiovascular Monitoring.

        "rationale": "Determining volume responsiveness is a critical step in resuscitation care. Using dynamic markers of preload responsiveness is increasing, given the physiologic superiority of this approach and the poor sensitivity and specificity of static markers, such as central venous pressure. Dynamic measurements such as pulse pressure variation, stroke volume variation, and ultrasound assessment, provide more accurate determinations of the patient\u2019s place on the Frank-Starling curve. Pulse pressure variation is often cited in the literature as one of the most precise measurements for determining volume status, but it is important to note that particular conditions apply. Positive pressure ventilation induces cyclic changes in preload and afterload on the right and left ventricle that are more pronounced when the patient is on the steep portion of the Frank-Starling curve. A pulse pressure variation of greater than 13% has been verified in the literature to indicate that the patient will likely be volume responsive. However, in order for this to be accurate, the patient must be in sinus rhythm, must not be taking spontaneous breaths, ideally should not be ventilated with very low tidal volumes, and should not have significant left ventricular or right ventricular dysfunction. This case also demonstrates the importance of performing a teritary survey on all trauma patients. References: 1. Marik PE, Monnet X, Teboul JL. Hemodynamic parameters to guide fluid therapy.

        "correct_answer": "E",
        "rationale": "Quantitative capnography should be considered for all mechanically ventilated patients because it provides a direct measurement of pulmonary ventilation. A normal ETCO2 value in a healthy adult should be 35 to 45 mm Hg. Capnography indirectly provides measurements on metabolism and cardiac output. Physiologic states that decrease whole body metabolism, hypothermia, and poor circulating volume will be reflected numerically as a decrease in ETCO2. In contrast, physiologic states that increase whole body metabolism, such as fever, will be reflected as an increase in ETCO2. Physiologic states that decrease cardiac output, such as a pulmonary embolism, will be reflected as a decrease in ETCO2. Pharmacologic interventions, such as giving a load of sodium bicarbonate, will be reflected almost immediately with an increase in ETCO2 as the lungs compensate for the increased carbon dioxide load. Quantitative capnography can provide confirmatory information with endotracheal intubation. An esophageal intubation may initially have an ETCO2 waveform due to intragastric CO2 that rapidly disappears. Two practical uses of quantitative capnography during cardiopulmonary resuscitation are: 1) evaluating the effectiveness of chest compressions, and 2) identifying return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). Highquality chest compressions are reflected by ETCO2 values between 10 and 20 mm Hg in the intubated patient. ROSC is reflected as a spontaneous significant increase in ETCO2 (toward the physiologic normal range of 35 mm Hg) as the heart improves cardiac output by regaining a rhythm and circulates CO2 into the lungs.

        "correct_answer": "A",
        "rationale": "The variation of the pulse pressure on an arterial line tracing during positive pressure mechanical ventilation reflects the effects of increasing and decreasing intrathoracic pressure in an alternating fashion, on stroke volume. This is sometimes best thought of by looking at the effects on the right and left heart separately. Focusing on the right side of the heart, during inspiration on a positive pressure breath, there is an increase in intrathoracic pressure as air is forced into the lungs and alveoli from the ventilator. The increased lung volume and pressure in the lungs and alveoli increases pulmonary vascular resistance, which increases right ventricular (RV) afterload. At the same time, the increase in intrathoracic pressure impedes venous return into the chest through the vena cava, which causes a decrease in preload. The combined effect of a decrease in preload and increase in afterload cause a decrease in stroke volume and cardiac output from the right heart into the pulmonary vasculature during inspiration. During the positive pressure breath, the vena cava begins to back up (venous return is impeded) until the expiratory phase begins and the patient exhales. During exhalation, the intrathoracic pressure drops and the there is a rush of blood into the right side of the heart, and RV preload increases. At the same time, with air now leaving the lung, the decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance and RV afterload favors an increase in stroke volume from the right ventricle. The net result is an increase in stroke volume and cardiac output during the expiratory phase of mechanical ventilation for the right side of the heart. On the left side of the heart we see the opposite effects, in part due to a time lag between the cardiac output during the preceding few beats, which is now arriving to the left. The primary mechanism affecting stroke volume in the left heart during inspiration is an increase in venous return, as the blood that was in the pulmonary vascular system is being pushed out as the lungs expand. In addition, although the cardiac output from the right side of the heart is diminished during the inspiratory phase, the blood returning to the left atrium from the lungs is the blood that was pumped from the right ventricle to the pulmonary vasculature during the expiratory phase immediately beforehand, which had a high stroke volume and high cardiac output. These two effects lead to an increase in venous return for the left ventricle and an increase in stroke volume throughout the inspiratory phase. This manifests as a progressive increase in the systolic pressure on the arterial waveform, as well as an increase in the pulse pressure throughout the inspiratory phase of a positive pressure mechanical breath (option A). Again, the opposite occurs on the left side of the heart during the expiratory phase. There is less venous return to the left ventricle because the cardiac output from the right was reduced during the preceding few beats. This results in a decrease in stroke volume, and decrease in systolic pressure on the arterial waveform (options B and C). These alterations in increasing and decreasing stroke volume with changes in intrathoracic pressure are exacerbated when a patient is on the ascending limb of the Frank-Starling curve. When end-diastolic volume is already adequate and the patient is on the plateau of the curve, the effects of positive pressure ventilation are diminished. The arterial line and ventilator tracings show the pulse pressure variations during mechanical ventilation. The systolic blood pressure and pulse pressure are maximal during inspiration and decline in expiration. References: 1. Marino PL. Principles of mechanical ventilation. In: The ICU Book. 3rd ed.

        "rationale": "The changes in pulse pressure variation (PPV) on an arterial line tracing are a manifestation of the change in intrathoracic pressure. Increasing the tidal volume will result in a greater change in intrathoracic pressure and have a greater effect on right ventricular (RV) venous return. Likewise, decreasing tidal volumes will mute this effect and diminish the variability. For optimal detection of PPV, tidal volumes of 8 to 10 mL/kg or greater have been recommended. Muscle relaxation with vecuronium (option C) will not interfere with accurate PPV measurements. Ventilator dyssynchrony will interrupt the rhythmic change in positive pressure in the chest and may interfere with accurately interpreting PPV. Muscle relaxation would therefore assist in obtaining accurate readings. Continuous renal replacement therapy running at net \u201350 mL/hr (option D) would not have an effect on the accuracy of PPV. It may make PPV more pronounced over time because volume is taken off but it will not change the ability to accurately assess PPV. Atrial fibrillation, premature ventricular contractions, premature atrial contractions, third-degree heart block, supraventricular tachycardia, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation will all interfere with the regular rhythmic heart rate needed to reliably determine PPV. Other variables that may decrease the effects of positive pressure ventilation on PPV include high respiratory rates, decreased lung compliance, decreased chest wall compliance, and RV failure.

She also is found to have a 70% stenosis of her right coronary artery (RCA). She is admitted to the ICU after an uneventful coronary artery bypass graft to her and an aortic valve replacement. Over the course of the evening, her central venous pressure (CVP) increases from 10 to 15 mm Hg and phenylephrine is started because her blood pressure begins to decrease and is unresponsive to the administration of two liters crystalloid. Pulmonary arterial pressures increase from 20/15 mm Hg to 40/20 mm Hg, and her urine output begins to decrease, with an elevated lactate level. Arterial blood gas analysis reveals pH 7.21, partial arterial oxygen pressure 167 mm Hg (30% fraction of inspired oxygen), partial arterial carbon dioxide pressure 33 mm Hg. Chest tube output remains serosanguinous 20 mL/hour. Cardiac enzymes are within normal limits. CVP tracing is shown below.

        "correct_answer": "C",
        "rationale": "This patient has clearly developed right heart failure as evidenced by her rising CVP, elevated pulmonary artery pressures, declining blood pressure, and renal failure. In cardiac tamponade, atrial and ventricular pressures equalize; therefore, when the tricuspid valve opens, there is not a prominent y descent. The x descent appears steep with an attenuated y descent. A pulmonary embolus (PE) would cause right ventricular (RV) strain and elevated CVP. A PE large enough to cause RV failure would also cause hypoxemia and tachypnea, leading to respiratory alkalosis. This patient demonstrates RV failure leading to elevated CVP, low mean arterial pressure due to severe tricuspid regurgitation, and volume overload. In a patient this size, the two liters of fluid given are likely to cause acute dilation of the right ventricle, stretching of the tricuspid annulus and acute tricuspid regurgitation that may lead to hepatic congestion, liver failure, and renal failure. Medical management includes inotropes and elevated heart rate to decrease diastolic filling time. The CVP waveform depicts an exaggerated v wave indicative of elevated RA pressure from backflow from the right ventricle into the RA through the patent tricuspid valve during ventricular systole when blood is supposed to be ejecting through the pulmonic valve.

        "rationale": "The prognosis of patients who are admitted in an unconscious state after successful cardiopulmonary resuscitation has significantly improved during the past decade, in large part because of aggressive post-resuscitation care, including the use of therapeutic targeted temperature management (TTM). In the early phase of postresuscitative care, assessment of neurologic outcome remains a challenge. In patients not treated with TTM, a lack of motor response or extensor response to pain and the absence of brainstem reflexes (including pupillary, corneal, and oculocephalic reactivity) at 72 hours post cardiac arrest are regarded as reliable signs of poor neurologic outcome. However, hypothermia reduces clearance of the sedative and analgesic agents commonly used during TTM. In addition, some patients may have altered renal and hepatic function after cardiac arrest, which may further delay drug clearance. The combined effects of TTM and controlled sedation alters portions of the neurologic examination, making it insufficiently accurate to predict prognosis in the early phase of unconsciousness post cardiac arrest. A recent metaanalysis of studies in patients treated with TTM post cardiac arrest found that a score of 1 to 2 on the motor portion of the Glascow Coma Scale at 72 hours had a high average false-positive rate of 21%. Brainstem responses had better accuracy, but absent corneal reflexes yielded an average false-positive rate of 2%, while bilaterally absent pupillary reflexes had the lowest false-positive rate (0.4%) to predict poor neurologic outcome. The presence of myoclonus, (distinct from status myoclonus) also has a high false-positive rate (5%) and should not be used to predict poor neurologic outcomes. A multimodal approach, including full neurologic examination, electrophysiologic testing (EEG and somatosensory evoked potentials), neuroimaging, and chemical biomarkers, provides the most reliable information for prognostication of unconscious cardiac arrest survivors.

        "rationale": "After submersion in water, victims initially hold their breath, which is then typically followed by laryngospasm, hypoxia and hypercarbia that then cause relaxation of the larynx and allow the aspiration of water. With decreases in body temperature, normal sinus rhythm transforms into sinus bradycardia, which is followed by atrial fibrillation, ventricular fibrillation, and asystole. Ongoing severe acidosis and hypoxemia contribute to instability of myocardial membranes and prevent restoration of normal sinus rhythm. In this case, venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (V-A ECMO) will help to rewarm, provide hemodynamic support in the settings of malignant ventricular arrhythmia and severe acidosis, and oxygenate. In the settings of non-hypothermiainduced out-of-hospital and in-hosptial cardiac arrest V-A ECMO is associated with survival rates of 10% to 30%. Rewarming with forced air, IV fluids, warm humidified gases, and gastric and bladder lavage are only effective in hypothermic patients with stable circulation. Ongoing attempts at defibrillation are unlikely to succeed until the patient is adequately rewarmed (greater than 30\u00b0C [86\u00b0F]). At 18\u00b0C (64.4\u00b0F), the brain can tolerate periods of circulatory arrest ten times longer than at 37\u00b0C. Dilated pupils can be caused by a variety of insults and must not be regarded as a sign of death. Good neurologic recovery has been reported after cardiac arrest and a core temperature of 13.7\u00b0C (56.66\u00b0F) after immersion in cold water with prolonged CPR. Therefore, patients should not be considered dead until rewarming efforts have failed. References: 1. Lavonas EJ, Drennan IR, Gabrielli A, et al.

        "correct_answer": "B",
        "rationale": "Blood supply to the thoracic spinal cord is largely dependent on a single anterior spinal artery and two posterolateral spinal arteries traveling cephalad to caudad. These arteries are largely dependent on blood supply from the anterior and posterior radicular arteries and the segmental medullary arteries. These originate from the segmental (intercostal) arteries, which arise from the thoracic aorta (see figure shown below). The largest of the segmental medullary arteries is the artery of Adamkiewicz, originating from the lower thoracic aorta (T8-L1) in most people. Interruption of blood flow through the intercostal arteries can occur as a result of endovascular graft deployment in the aorta. Patients at higher risk for spinal cord ischemia postoperatively include those with: 1) decrease/disruption of collateral circulation due to prior abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, severe atherosclerosis of the thoracic aorta resulting in decreased collateral circulation, or more extensive graft coverage of thoracic aorta, 2) hypotension resulting in decreased spinal cord perfusion pressure, or 3) increased spinal fluid pressure or central venous pressure. Spinal cord perfusion pressure is calculated as mean arterial pressure minus cerebrospinal fluid pressure (or central venous pressure). Spinal drains are often placed before thoracic endograft procedures to reduce the resistance to blood flow, thereby encouraging spinal cord perfusion. Maintaining spinal cord perfusion is especially critical in the early postoperative period, when the spinal cord may be recovering from intraoperative ischemic insult. Decreased neurologic function after aortic repair is a neurologic emergency; taking action to improve spinal cord perfusion is essential to minimize long-term squealae. The spinal drain can be opened or repositioned to increase drainage of cerebrospinal fluid to improve spinal cord perfusion. Increasing blood pressure will also increase spinal cord perfusion.

As is the case here, presentations mimicking pneumonia or nonvalvular heart failure may complicate the picture, delaying definitive therapy. Given the diastolic murmur, evidence of mixed cardiogenic and septic shock, needle track marks, and blood cultures positive for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), the most likely diagnosis is infective endocarditis causing acute aortic regurgitation. Treatment should be directed at broadening antibiotic coverage to include MRSA, obtaining an immediate echocardiography to confirm the diagnosis, and involving cardiac surgery for definitive management. Instituting appropriate medical therapy, including vasopressors, inotropes, and intubation, is necessary, but is not a substitute for surgical therapy in such a critically ill state. Providing additional IV fluid boluses is unlikely to improve hypotension, and may worsen oxygenation given evidence of cardiogenic shock. Placing an intra-aortic balloon pump is contraindicated here due to aortic insufficiency and worsening of the regurgitation when the balloon inflates during diastole. Delaying surgical repair for days until blood cultures return negative is not optimal management in this setting. References: 1. Stout KK, Verrier ED. Acute valvular regurgitation.

        "correct_answer": "C",
        "rationale": "Acute aortic insufficiency, either perivalvular or central, is a known complication of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), with an incidence reported as high as 70%. Acute aortic regurgitation results in sudden volume overload to the left ventricle (LV) during systole. As a result of this, LV end-systolic volume is higher than normal and the pressure gradient between the left atrium and the LV decreases earlier in subsequent diastole. This results in early mitral valve closure, which is audible as a soft S1 sound. Early systolic and even diastolic mitral regurgitation have been observed due to changes in ventriculo-arterial gradient in the LV. This leads to a reduction in LV stroke volume and a reflex tachycardia. As a result, patients often have thready pulses and cold extremities. Pericardial tamponade has been observed after TAVR, but is rare. In addition, the patient\u2019s jugular venous pulsation is reported to be 5 cm above the sternal angle with slow refill, which is inconsistent with tamponade. Sepsis is associated with tachycardia and hypotension, but usually not with cold extremities and a normal temperature. Acute third-degree heart block has been reported after TAVR, but is not usually associated with a rapid heart rate. Complete loss of atrioventricular conduction can cause decreased cardiac output and hypotension, but usually the cause of diminished cardiac output is bradycardia, not decreased stroke volume. In addition a diastolic murmur is usually not observed. Ascending aortic dissection is a rare but known complication, certainly rarer than aortic insufficiency. However, this should be accompanied by coronary ischemia. A typical murmur associated with acute mitral regurgitation is a high-pitched, blowing holosystolic murmur. References: 1.

The most prudent course of action when first examining him would be to perform a rapid ultrasound assessment for shock and hypotension (RUSH) examination and provide an IV fluid bolus once the effusion is seen. At that point, a decision would need to be made to drain the effusion at the bedside or in the catheterization laboratory, depending on his clinical status. Bedside ultrasound for acute dyspnea and shock is a critical tool for intensivists. This will help rapidly narrow the differential diagnosis and improve decision making. Intubating the patient may eventually be necessary but, given his mental status, adequate oxygenation, and profound hypotension, this may not be the first action to take. Septic shock certainly remains in the differential diagnosis, and providing antibiotics and obtaining cultures may still be advisable even with tamponade findings on ultrasound. Based on history and examination, it is less likely that this presentation is acute heart failure or pulmonary embolism, and bedside cardiac ultrasound will also help to prove this. A significant retroperitoneal bleed may be the cause of his hypotension, but history and examination are relatively inconsistent with this, and protamine is not a pure reversal agent for enoxaparin, but it may help.

        "correct_answer": "D",
        "rationale": "Although a rare and challenging diagnosis to make, this patient has hypersensitivity eosinophilic myocarditis and is in fulminant heart failure. The offending agent in this case is phenytoin, which the patient has taken for seizures for many years. Although not always present, peripheral eosinophilia can be a clue, in addition to the faint rash noted on the trunk. Due to the high mortality associated with this disease, early diagnosis is key, and an endomyocardial biopsy is the test of choice. Once the diagnosis is confirmed, in addition to withdrawal of the offending drug, immunosuppressive therapy can commence, often with dramatic results. A right upper quadrant ultrasound would be prudent, given the elevated liver function tests, but this is most likely due to congestive hepatopathy, and would not yield a diagnosis. Similarly, a skin punch biopsy and blood cultures would probably be performed on this patient to look for autoimmune and infectious causes, but an endomyocardial biopsy would still be needed. A chest CT would be a low-yield test, and may even cause harm, given his acute kidney injury. References: 1. Al Ali AM, Straatman LP, Allard MF, Ignaszewski AP.

        "correct_answer": "A",
        "rationale": "In patients with myasthenic crisis, subjective assessment is combined with pulmonary function testing to guide the decision about ventilator support. General warning signs include increasing generalized weakness, dysphagia, dysphonia, and dyspnea on exertion and at rest. Signs on subjective assessment include tachycardia, weak cough, staccato speech, accessory muscle use, rapid shallow breathing, abdominal paradox, orthopnea, and weakness of trapezius and neck muscles. Objective assessment should follow the 20/30/40 rule: vital capacity less than 20 mL/kg (normal 40-70 mL/kg), maximal inspiratory pressure less than or equal to 30 cm H2O (normal greater than or equal to 100 cm H2O), and maximal expiratory pressure less than 40 cm H2O (normal greater than 200 cm H2O) should prompt airway protection with endotracheal intubation. Noninvasive bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) can be effective for treating acute respiratory failure in patients with myasthenia gravis. A BiPAP trial before the development of hypercapnia (greater than 50 mm Hg) can prevent intubation and prolonged ventilation, reducing pulmonary complications and lengths of ICU and hospital stays. However, this patient has significant hypercapnia and increased secretions and might not benefit from BiPAP. There is no role for heliox in the management of myasthenic crisis. IV immunoglobulin or plasma exchange is considered the standard of care for patients with myasthenic crisis. However, this patient needs airway protection before definitive treatment. With regard to intubation, nondepolarizing agents (eg, vecuronium) have increased potency, and reduced doses are required for paralysis. Propofol and fentanyl can be used safely for intubation without using neuromuscular blockers. This patient needs ventilator support. Increasing the pyridostigmine dose will not prevent the need for intubation. Pyridostigmine can be stopped during mechanical ventilation and gradually restarted. Excess of pyridostigmine can cause cholinergic crisis. Steroids can also exaggerate myasthenia. However, steroids are considered for myasthenic crisis if there is no improvement after five days of plasma exchange. References: 1. Seneviratne J, Mandrekar J, Wijdicks EF, Rabinstein AA.

The supine position, in contrast to the semirecumbent position (greater than 45\u00b0 head of bed), is a risk factor for VAP; therefore it is recommended to elevate the head of the bed in mechanically ventilated patients to decrease the risk of VAP.

The patient\u2019s ability to tolerate the observed degree of respiratory acidosis reflects the chronicity of the disease and the gradual progression if untreated. The initial management decision is whether to institute invasive or noninvasive management. Given the morbidity and mortality associated with the use of mechanical ventilation, and the nonurgent presentation, the best approach is to initiate noninvasive ventilation and assess for responsiveness. In the outpatient setting, continuous positive airway pressure is initiated and transitioned to bilevel support if hypoxemia cannot be corrected. In this urgent scenario, initiation of bilevel support is reasonable. If the patient\u2019s symptoms are refractory to escalating levels of noninvasive ventilation, or if her condition worsens, invasive mechanical ventilation would be required. The presence of lower extremity edema suggests cor pulmonale and/or pulmonary hypertension. Over time, diuresis may prove to be an effective strategy, but is less useful in the acute setting than the initiation of ventilator support given her lethargy and arterial blood gas values. An echocardiogram would be useful to examine the left and right ventricular size and function, and to assess for pulmonary hypertension.

        "rationale": "Pressure support (PS) is a patient-triggered, pressure-targeted, flow-cycled form of mechanical ventilatory support. Clinicians can select the breath-triggering sensitivity and the pressure target. Until recently, however, the flow-cycling (flow termination) criteria were fixed by the ventilator manufacturer as some percentage of the peak inspiratory flow. To improve patient ventilator synchrony and/or reduce the potential for excessive inspiratory time (a problem in patients with obstructive lung disease), newer ventilators allow the clinician to adjust the flow-cycling criteria; this is what has happened in this patient. Option D is correct. In breath A, the peak inspiratory flow is 75 L/min, and the breath is cycling (flow terminated) when flow falls to 20% of this flow, or 15 L/min. In breath B, the clinician has increased the flow cycling criteria to 50% of the peak inspiratory flow, or 38 L/min. Stopping flow when it is still high relative to peak flow has shortened the inspiratory time and reduced the delivered volume. An alternative approach to controlling inspiratory time using a patient-triggered, pressure-targeted breath is to use a pressure assist breath (pressure assist-control ventilation [PACV] with the set rate below the spontaneous rate) where the clinician directly sets the inspiratory time. The mode here, however, is stated as PS, not PACV. A reduced compliance with PS will reduce both the peak inspiratory flow and delivered volume, but breath timing changes are occurring here. The PS mode does not have a volume setting, although some ventilators do provide a feedback pressure setting based on delivered volume, which is known as the volume support mode. There is no rate setting in pressure support. References: 1. Dekel, B., Segal, E. and Perel, A., 1996. Pressure support ventilation. Archives of Internal Medicine, 156(4), pp.369-373. 2.

Because of this, a common practice is to simply assume that thoracic cage compliance is very high, intrapleural pressure is consequently very low, and thus the measured airway pressure under no-flow conditions (plateau pressure [Pplat]) is a reasonable reflection of the transpulmonary pressure. Morbid obesity (body mass index greater than 40) produces a marked reduction in thoracic cage compliance. Studies looking at mechanical ventilation in such patients have generally shown very high intrapleural pressures with the application of a positive pressure breath. The simple Pplat measurement thus will reflect not only transpulmonary pressure across the alveolus but also the intrapleural pressure required to push out the stiff thoracic cage. Pplat alone will grossly overestimate the transpulmonary pressure and put an inappropriate limit on the airway pressures that could be used to support morbidly obese patients. Esophageal pressure monitoring would give a more accurate measure of the transpulmonary pressures. References: 1. Pelosi P, Croci M, Ravagnan I, Vicardi P, Gattinoni L.

Pneumonia has developed in the transplanted left lung, requiring mechanical ventilatory support. A double-lumen tube is inserted to ventilate each lung separately. Which of the following is the most important strategy for setting up the two ventilators?",
        "correct_answer": "D",
        "rationale": "Managing a patient with markedly different lung mechanics in each lung poses significant problems, as in this patient with a single left lung transplant producing a markedly stiff lung on the left and a high-compliance lung with narrow airways on the right. When managed with a single ventilatory support strategy, undesirable gas distribution and ventilation-perfusion relationships may result. Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) application can be problematic, in that PEEP would be desirable in the edematous stiff lung but clearly undesirable in an obstructive lung that is already overdistended. To address this, double-lumen tubes allow independent ventilatory parameters to be set in each lung. In setting up these ventilators, the ventilatory pattern and PEEP in each lung can then be titrated to the specific clinical goal. Since a primary goal of any ventilatory strategy is to prevent overdistension and ventilator-induced lung injury. Limiting the end-inspiratory (maximal) stretching pressure (plateau pressure) in the lungs to less than 30 to 35 cm H2O reduces this risk. A 6 mL/kg ideal body weight tidal volume in each lung would be a total tidal volume of 12 mL/kg ideal body weight, clearly excessive and likely to produce ventilator-induced lung injury in healthier regions of either lung. The differential PEEP is one of the goals of independent lung ventilation. PEEP is needed in the edematous lung, not the emphysematous lung. The respiratory rate settings in the two lungs do not need to be synchronized. References: 1. Anantham D, Jagadesan R, Tiew PE. Clinical review: independent lung ventilation in critical care.

        "correct_answer": "B",
        "rationale": "In this scenario, heliox is contraindicated because of the degree to which the patient requires oxygen. A helium-to-oxygen admixture is typically 70:30 (30% oxygen). Therefore, anyone requiring more than 30% oxygen should not receive heliox therapy because of the risk of hypoxia. Because helium is less dense than air, it will decrease resistance in the large airways. Heliox improves airflow limitation in large airways by decreasing turbulent flow. This improves ventilation and carbon dioxide elimination. Heliox may also improve intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure, decrease pulsus paradoxus, and improve peak expiratory flow rate. In short, it may improve ventilation until bronchodilators and corticosteroids can improve the degree of bronchospasm. However, there have been no large controlled trials to demonstrate any impact on outcome. The patient\u2019s pregnancy should not alter her therapy. In general, the risk of inadequate therapy for asthma outweighs the risks associated with the use of asthma medications. Conventional therapy for asthma (bronchodilators and corticosteroids) should be administered to all pregnant patients with acute asthma exacerbation, but epinephrine therapy is not recommended in pregnancy.

        "correct_answer": "A",
        "rationale": "Recent Society of Critical Care Medicine guidelines have examined appropriate continuous infusion strategies for patients requiring indwelling devices and mechanical ventilation. These recommendations are based on the pain, agitation, and delirum guidelines. Once an appropriate sedation strategy goal is identified (eg, a Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale goal based on patient characteristics, disease state, critical illness, etc.), appropriate medications can be selected. The first goal for continuous infusion should be to adequately control pain by using a short-acting narcotic agent such as fentanyl. Once pain has been adequately addressed, providing sedation is the next step. Ideally, intermittent doses of sedatives should be used first. If that fails to control agitation, then a continuous sedative infusion should be initiated. Studies have shown an increased association between delirium and continuous benzodiazepine infusions. At this time, continuous benzodiazepine infusions would be considered a second-line sedative agent. Potential first-line agents include dexmedetomidine and propofol. Neither of these agents has shown a superior effect profile for reducing delirium. Antipsychotics, including haloperidol, have also been studied as potential agents to limit ICU delirium. Studies have shown haloperidol to have a favorable affect on acute agitation, but no significant decrease on overall delirium. Once pain and agitation have been controlled, the clinician should continue to screen for delirium with tools such as the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU, since morbidity and mortality have been linked to unrecognized delirium.

Effects of ketamine include vagolysis and direct smooth muscle relaxation, therefore helping with bronchospasm refractory to bronchodilators. This will lead to a decrease in peak inspiratory pressures and an increase in dynamic compliance. Ketamine causes minimal respiratory depression since it does not inhibit the central carbon dioxide reflex. Ketamine will preserve functional residual capacity, minute ventilation, and tidal volume, unlike other sedatives that are used for induction. In fact, some studies show a small increase in respiratory rate and corresponding improved oxygenation and improved ventilation. Finally, variation exists with ketamine dosing. Ketamine increases oropharyngeal secretions and does not affect pulmonary secretions. References: 1. Lazarus, SC. Clinical practice. Emergency treatment of asthma.

High-flow oxygen therapy creates a positive pressure effect on the upper airway and is tolerated better than other forms of ventilation. If the patient required mechanical ventilation to support him through his viral pneumonia, then that would be the correct choice, but a trial of noninvasive ventilation before mechanical ventilation with its concomitant morbidities is reasonable. The literature is mixed on whether noninvasive ventilation decreases mortality in patients with hypoxic respiratory failure.

The mortality for severe ARDS by Berlin criteria is 45%, with few interventions showing clinical benefit. Low tidal volume ventilation (<6 mL/kg/predicted body weight [PBW] with goal plateau pressures less than 30 cm H2O) decreased mortality by 8.8% in a randomized controlled trial. Inhaled pulmonary vasodilators, by selective vasodilatation to ventilated alveoli, improve oxygenation in patients with ARDS, but they do not improve mortality. A meta-analysis of inhaled nitric oxide use showed that it is associated with an increased incidence of acute kidney injury. In a randomized controlled trial examining optimal positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) settings, the open-lung approach combining low tidal volume, lung recruitment maneuvers, and high PEEP did not decrease mortality in patient with ARDS. It did decrease death from refractory hypoxemia and did not lead to significantly more barotrauma. In a randomized controlled trial, statins decreased neither ventilator-free days nor mortality in patients with ARDS. Venovenous extracorpeal membranous oxygenation (VV ECMO) continues to be used more frequently for severe ARDS. The CESAR trial showed that referral to an ECMO-capable center reduced mortality in severe ARDS, but the control arm received significantly less lung-protective ventilation than the ECMO-referred cohort, which is a criticism of the trial. VV ECMO can improve oxygenation and provide near total lung rest to decrease ventilator-associated lung injury, and should be offered on a case-by-case basis after conventional therapies and adjunctive ARDS management strategies have been exhausted. Prone positioning was associated with a 16% absolute risk reduction for mortality when done for early, severe ARDS, and proning was maintained for prolonged periods.

        "rationale": "There has been tremendous growth in the field of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) during the past 15 years. Most importantly, lung-protective ventilation with tidal volumes near 6 mL/kg predicted body weight has significantly decreased patient mortality. Beyond that, there has been much debate over other adjuncts that may also improve mortality. These include paralytics, optimal positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) levels, inhaled pulmonary vasodilators (nitric oxide, epoprostenol), high-frequency oscillatory ventilation, and prone positioning. This patient has severe ARDS after significant trauma and, despite optimal ventilator management, is still hypoxic with a partial arterial oxygen pressure of 50 mm Hg. At this point, further supportive measures are required to improve oxygenation. PEEP at 22 cm H2O is near maximum and, on pressure control ventilation with a peak airway pressure of 35 cm H2O, further titration upwards may subject the lungs to unwanted ventilator-associated lung injury. Permissive hypercapnea in ARDS management is well tolerated, and with a pH of 7.24 and a respiratory rate of 35 breaths/min, no further adjustments should be made. No single mode of ventilation has been proven to be superior to another; therefore, changing the mode to assist control/volume control is unlikely to help. Inhaled pulmonary vasodilators such as epoprostenol and nitric oxide are often used, but no study has shown a decrease in mortality with their use. Furthermore, nitric oxide may be linked to acute kidney injury and is very expensive. Prone ventilation in severe ARDS has been shown to decrease mortality if done early and for long enough periods of time.

        "rationale": "This patient is having a ventilator crisis, which can be caused by a number of different scenarios. It is important to quickly make the diagnosis while minimizing morbidity and exposure to unhelpful and potentially harmful therapies. A helpful mnemonic is DOPE, which stands for displacement, obstruction, pneumothorax, and equipment failure. The first thing that should be accomplished is to ensure that the endotracheal tube is still secure and in the correct location and the patient-ventilator circuit is intact and functioning. This should follow a stepwise approach and proceed from the patient to the ventilator. Look, listen and feel at the airway. The endotracheal tube (ETT) should not be pushed out or at a shallower depth than previously recorded. Direct inspection of the airway with a laryngoscope may be required to ensure that the ETT is not above the vocal cords. There should be no audible air leaks, and the pilot balloon should not be deflated or easy to fully compress. A pilot balloon that does not retain pressure probably signals a leak somewhere in the system. If the tube is dislodged or malfunctioning, it should be replaced immediately because this is an emergency. An exhaled tidal volume that is significantly less than prescribed tidal volume strongly suggests tube displacement or cuff leak. A quick inspection of the ventilator tubing will reveal any dislodgment. Next, obstruction is ruled out by placing a suction catheter down the tube. The P in DOPE classically stands for pneumothorax. Other P\u2019s should also be considered: plugging of mucus and too much (auto)-PEEP. Pneumothorax should be evaluated by multiple means. The first is to listen for decreased breath sounds and look for asymmetric chest rise and tracheal deviation. However, clinical examination can be inaccurate. A decrease in compliance, as evidenced by increased ventilator pressures, can often be seen. Empiric treatment of pneumothorax is sometimes required, but this is not the most appropriate next step. A chest radiograph can be helpful but, again, this is not the most appropriate next step because it can take a significant amount of time to obtain, leading to a delay in diagnosis. Provider-initiated point-of-care ultrasound can be used to quickly rule out pneumothorax. Ultrasound and chest radiograph can also diagnose mucus plugging. Examination of ventilator waveforms and performance of an expiratory pause pressure can determine auto- PEEP. In some scenarios, such as a crashing patient with an obstructive lung disease such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, it may be appropriate to disconnect the patient from the ventilator, allow a full exhale and then manually breath for the patient with a bag valve mask (BVM). If the patient is easy to oxygenate and ventilate with a BVM, this suggests ventilator equipment failure. It is only after these maneuvers are tried should other treatment strategies for hypoxemia be initiated. References: 1. Wright BJ.

Permissive hypercapnea is typically tolerated quite well. In this case, increasing the respiratory rate in order to normalize the blood gas resulted in a reduction in exhalation time. In a patient with severe COPD and expiratory flow limitation, the resultant auto-PEEP resulted in cardiovascular collapse. Disconnecting the patient from the ventilator and allowing him to exhale may result in return of spontaneous circulation. Performing bilateral needle thoracostomies may be considered in this case, given the higher likelihood of pneumothoraces in a patient with COPD but this is less likely in this scenario. Similarly, epinephrine is standard for advanced cardiac life support, but that will not solve the problem causing this patient\u2019s cardiac arrest. Venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation could be considered, but attempting other maneuvers first is more prudent.

The most common presentation of patients with Brugada syndrome is syncope, ventricular fibrillation-induced cardiac arrest, and cardiac death. ECG findings follow a Brugada pattern, which consists of a pseudo-right bundle branch block and persistent ST segment elevation in leads V1-V3. There have been isolated cases of similar findings involving the inferior ECG leads. Previously, there were three different patterns of ST elevation described and used in practice; subsequent consensus is that there are two distinct patterns: In type 1, the elevated ST segments that are greater than 2 mm descend with an upward convexity to an inverted T wave. This is referred to as the coved-type Brugada pattern. In type 2, the ST segment has a \u201csaddleback\u201d ST-T wave configuration in which the elevated ST segment descends toward the baseline, then rises again to an upright or biphasic T wave. This patient\u2019s ECG illustrates a type 1 Brugada pattern. The average age at diagnosis is 41 and, for unknown reasons, patients with schizophrenia are more likely than the general population to have Brugada-pattern ECGs. There does not seem to be a significant impact of schizophrenia medications, and the Brugada pattern and clinical significance of this association is undetermined. The syndrome is autosomal dominant due to a mutation in a cardiac sodium channel. A mutation in the alpha-subunit gene, SCN5A, has been identified in 15% to 30% of patients. An implantable defibrillator should be considered to prevent recurrent ventricular fibrillation and sudden death. Thrombolysis is not applicable for patients with Brugada syndrome. Patients treated with type 1a antiarrhythmics, such as procainamide, after cardiac arrest who have normal ECGs at baseline may elicit ECG findings similar to Brugada pattern. Beta-blockers and amiodarone are not helpful in this syndrome and should be avoided. References: 1. Brugada P, Brugada J.

        "rationale": "The high peak airway pressure (HPAP) alarm is one of the most common alarms for patients receiving mechanical ventilation. In patients, such as this one, who are hemodynamically unstable, differential diagnosis of HPAP includes auto-PEEP, tension pneumothorax, a kinked or dislodged endotracheal tube (ETT) and a large mucus plug. The diagnostic algorithm for a hemodynamically unstable patient is shown below. The first step in a hemodynamically unstable patient with HPAP, is to disconnect the patient from the ventilator while assessing whether the ETT is dislodged. If the ETT is properly placed and a rush of air is heard when disconnecting the patient from the ventilator with improvement in hemodynamics within a few seconds, the most likely cause is auto-PEEP. If the problem is not corrected after the patient is disconnected from the ventilator, the next step is to hand-ventilate and assess ease of squeezing and the amount of chest wall rise. If resistance is met and asymmetric chest wall rise is appreciated, the next step is to assess for breath sounds. In the absence of breath sounds, tension pneumothorax should be suspected and needle decompression performed. Lastly, if breath sounds are present, a suctioning catheter should be inserted. If suctioning catheter cannot be passed, a kinked ETT should be suspected. If suctioning catheter passes with ease, the patient should be suctioned. If there is improvement, then mucus plug is the most likely diagnosis. The high peak inspiratory pressures and low expiratory tidal volume immediately after intubation suggest an airway related problem. In this clinical scenario, an esophageal intubation is of great concern; other clues to ETT misplacement are inability to ventilate and oxygenate with severe respiratory acidosis and hypoxemia in conjunction with HPAP. Changing the ventilator setting to pressure control will decrease the pressure in the airway, but will not correct the underlying problem of a misplaced ETT. This is a life-threatening situation and should be corrected as soon as possible. Of note, this patient\u2019s chest radiograph and end-tidal carbon dioxide (CO2) suggest proper ETT placement. While chest radiographs are useful for detecting endobronchial placement of ETT, detecting esophageal intubation may be difficult because the esophagus lies posterior to the trachea. It should never be relied upon to detect esophageal intubation since dealth may result if ETT misplacement is not detected until a radiograph is obtained. The measurement of CO2 in the exhaled gas has become one of the standard methods of verifying ETT location. CO2 detection relies on the presence of pulmonary circulation (ie, it might not be detected in patients with inadequate cardiopulmonary resuscitation) and, also, severe airway obstruction may prevent sufficient CO2 exhalation to be detected by capnometers. Small concentrations of CO2 may be detected after an esophageal intubation, especially if bag-and-mask ventilation has insufflated exhaled air into the stomach. Repeating chest radiograph to assess for a pneumothorax in a hemodynamically unstable patient will lead to an unnecessary delay in treatment. Tension pneumothorax is a lifethreatening condition and, if clinically suspected, needle decompression should be performed without confirmatory test. In this case, the HPAP started right after intubation and chest radiograph performed post-intubation did not show a pneumothorax, making tension pneumothorax less likely. Starting vasopressors would not correct the underlying problem and might delay appropriate treatment. There is no role for bicarbonate infusion since the patient is in severe respiratory acidosis due to a ventilation problem. References: 1. Rudraraju P, Eisen LA.

        "rationale": "The optimal technique for central line insertion is constantly being refined. A randomized controlled trial showed that experienced operators can safely place subclavian venous access in critically ill patients using ultrasound guidance. Experienced clinicians benefitted from the use of real-time ultrasound guidance and had lower incidences of mechanical complications, including pneumothoraces and arterial punctures. The ultrasound group also took statistically less time to place venous access, had fewer numbers of attempts and achieved placement 100% of the time compared to the landmark group. In contrast, catheter misplacement was the same in both groups. Learners who perform the anatomic-based placement technique make six common technical errors: 1) failure to palpate two bony landmarks, 2) failure to insert the needle at the recommended distance of 1 cm inferior and lateral to the medial third of the clavicle, 3) insertion of the needle through the clavicular periosteum, 4) too shallow of a trajectory of the needle, 5) aiming the needle too cephelad, and 6) failure to keep the needle in place for wire passage. Learners are more successful in placing right-sided subclavians rather than left-sided ones, probably due to hand dominance. The use of ultrasound guidance for the subclavian approach is hindered by shadowing from the clavicle, and what is cannulated is the axillary vein, which then joins the subclavian vein. Complication rates from central venous access increase with the number of attempts and the choice of site, as noted in the three-site trial where patients with subclavian lines had 1.5% penumothorax rate versus those with internal jugular lines who had a 0.5% pneumothorax rate.

The true sensitivity and specificity of transthoracic echocardiography in the diagnosis of PE is difficult to assess and is related to preexisting conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and the size and hemodynamic compromise of the clot burden, but sensitivity ranges from 60% to 90% and specificity ranges from 80% to 95%. Other useful indicators are increase of tricuspid regurgitant peak gradient calculated on a fourchamber view plus central venous pressure that translates into high pulmonary pressure.

Despite this, routine post-procedural chest radiograph is not always performed in uncomplicated cases. In this patient, the most likely diagnosis, given the constellation of clinical findings of greatly diminished breath sounds on the right side, elevated jugular venous distension, tachycardia, hypotension with narrowed pulse pressure, tachypnea, and hypoxemia, is tension pneumothorax. The most critical immediate intervention is to perform a needle or tube thoracostomy to relieve the tension and re-expand the lung before the onset of complete hemodynamic collapse. Endotracheal intubation will probably be unnecessary if urgent decompressive thoracostomy is performed, and the likelihood of tolerating anesthetic induction in the presence of a tension pneumothorax is doubtful. Although pulmonary embolism is also a possibility, the absence of breath sounds immediately after this procedure should increase the likelihood of tension pneumothorax. A chest CT angiogram would help to differentiate between these two potential diagnoses, but would only delay the urgent treatment necessary to restore hemodynamic stability. Furthermore, compromising this patient\u2019s situation by sending her for a CT in her currently unstable state is not recommended. References: 1.

Portable chest radiograph (Figure 1), pelvis radiograph (Figure 2), and bedside ultrasound (Figure 3) are shown below. After initial fluid resuscitation, there is no change in vital signs.

        "rationale": "This multisystem trauma patient is in acute circulatory shock. Trauma patients should receive an organized and rapid team-based resuscitation that follows Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) or Anaesthesia Trauma And Critical Care (ATACC) guidelines. Both of these courses focus on rapid assessment and immediate stabilization of airway, breathing, and circulation. This patient has been successfully intubated, and resuscitation with crystalloids and ideally blood products has begun. Clinical assessment, radiograph, and ultrasound can be used to rapidly diagnosis the cause of acute circulatory shock. Hypovolemic shock from acute blood loss is the most common cause, but obstructive (tension pneumothorax, cardiac tamponade), cardiogenic (blunt cardiac injury), and distributive shock (neurogenic) can also occur. Extended focuses assessment with sonography in trauma (eFAST) examination can help the clinician rapidly diagnosis tension pneumothorax, pericardial tamponade, and intraperitoneal free fluid, which, in this clinical situation, probably means intraabdominal bleeding. The patient is hypotensive after initial resuscitation. Chest radiograph does not reveal pneumothorax, and pelvic radiograph reveals no fracture. The view of the right upper quadrant on the eFAST examination reveals fluid in the Morrison pouch between the liver and kidney. In this clinical scenario, these findings cause concern for intra-abdominal hemorrhage. The patient should immediately undergo exploratory laparotomy and damage control surgery focusing on rapid control of life-threatening hemorrhage and control of contamination (as opposed to a definitive and complete operation). The placement of IV access is critically important in the unstable trauma patient. The ability to provide rapid fluid resuscitation is required because hypovolemic shock from acute blood loss is the most likely cause of acute circulatory shock in this patient. If adequate peripheral access is obtained, obtaining central access should not delay surgical control of bleeding. If central venous access is needed, it is necessary to understand the differences and strengths of different types of central venous access. Standard triple-lumen catheters are useful for administering multiple different medications at once as well as vasopressors. Their length and relatively narrow internal diameters do not facilitate rapid flow. In fact, the distal brown lumen of a triple-lumen catheter has a slower maximum flow rate (52 mL/min) than a 20-gauge peripheral IV (60 mL/min). If central access is required, a cordis or introducer should be used. A pressure bag or rapid infuser will greatly increase flow. Diagnostic peritoneal lavage (DPL) is unnecessary in the setting of a positive eFAST examination in this hemodynamically unstable blunt trauma patient. DPL is an alternative to eFAST for the detection of massive hemorrhage in an unstable trauma patient, although it can require more time, and is invasive and prone to more complications in inexperienced hands. The presence of a positive eFAST examination makes DPL unnecessary and the time wasted delaying surgery could be harmful. Blunt trauma patients often have injuries of multiple different organ systems. A major concern is delayed treatment of other life-threatening injuries. It may be tempting to obtain a CT to rule out intracranial injuries. However, delaying control of lifethreatening bleeding can prove fatal. Management of neurotrauma focuses on preserving cerebral perfusion pressure, which is equal to mean arterial pressure minus intracranial pressure. Hemorrhage and hypotension should be managed before diagnosis of potential intracranial injuries. Empiric placement of an intracranial monitor is controversial at best in an under-resuscitated patient. Either way it should not delay damage control surgery. References: 1.

        "correct_answer": "C",
        "rationale": "Adequate fetal oxygenation requires a maternal arterial oxygen tension (PaO2) greater than 70 mm Hg, which corresponds to an oxygen saturation as measured by pulse oximetry of 95%. Hypoxemia in the pregnant patient has dual impact on the mother and fetus and should be immediately reversed with supplemental oxygen. Pregnancy induces anatomic changes that include an elevated diaphragm and an increase in diameter of the chest cavity. Pregnancy leads to decreased functional residual capacity and increased minute ventilation. Hypoxemia during airway management has the potential to be a severe cause of morbidity and mortality, even more so in the hypoxic pregnant patient with limited reserve. Even with preoxygenation, patients with little reserve can have rapid desaturation events during airway manipulation. Nasal prongs are ubiquitous in most healthcare settings. A simple intervention is to start high-flow oxygenation at 10-15 L/min with any planned airway manipulation. Even with induction and/or paralysis, oxygen will still move downgradient into the alveoli and diffuse into the passing oxygen-poor bloodstream. Apneic oxygenation has been shown to delay time to desaturation and maintain a higher PaO2 throughout the intubation procedure. In fact, this technique is often used during brain death examinations to prevent hypoxemia. Carbon dioxide continues to diffuse from the bloodstream into the alveoli but does not travel further (leading to less diffusion and increased buildup in the circulating blood). Apneic oxygenation does not protect against hypercapnia or respiratory acidosis, similar to what is induced with the brain death examination. No data exist to show that apneic oxygenation decreases the incidence of anoxic brain injury in the fetus. References: 1. Mighty HE. Acute respiratory failure in pregnancy.

Various interventions for refractory hypoxemia have been covered in the literature, such as 1) alveolar recruitment with dedicated ventilator recruitment maneuvers, 2) following positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) tables to increase mean airway pressure, 3) open-lung ventilation strategies such as airway pressure release ventilation, 4) inhaled pulmonary vasodilators to help with ventilation/perfusion mismatch, 5) paralytic infusions, and 6) prone positioning. Recently, Guerin et al showed that prone positioning applied early in severe ARDS led to an absolute risk reduction in mortality of approximately 16%. Their strategy was to apply prone positioning early, after a stabilization period, and for at least 16 hours a day. Their data showed no difference in the incidence of complications, including extubations, between the study groups. The OSCILLATE trial investigators showed an increase in mortality in moderate to severe ARDS with early application of high-flow oscillator ventilation. This patient already has a plateau pressure of 29 mm H2O. Increasing the PEEP to 15 cm H2O will have the effect of pushing his pleateau pressure above 30 cm H2O, unless compliance improves with increased PEEP, and prior ARDS data has shown increased mortality with maintained plateau pressure over 30 cm H2O. Referral to a center capable of providing venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was shown to reduce mortality in severe ARDS, but there are several potential therapies before initiating ECMO. Inhaled nitric oxide has been shown to improve oxygenation, but does not improve outcome, and is associated with kidney injury. References: 1.

This can be at any level in the circuit but commonly a ruptured balloon can cause a leak. In the setting of a circuit leak, decreasing the tidal volume would decrease minute volume and increase end-tidal carbon dioxide, and might worsen oxygenation by permitting alveolar collapse. Inhaled bronchodilators are not appropriate since there is no evidence of acute obstructive lung disease. Suctioning the endotracheal tube is not likely to be effective since there is no evidence of intrathoracic obstruction. Reintubating the patient might be necessary but this would not be the next step since the cuff might require simple reinstillation of air. References: 1. Main E, Castle R, Stocks J, James I, Hatch D.

        "rationale": "This patient has pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), and right heart failure. She has New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class (FC) IV symptoms (dyspnea at rest/right heart failure). The hemodynamics are consistent with severe PAH with depressed cardiac output and cardiac index and a severely elevated pulmonary vascular resistance. The elevated right atrial pressure and low cardiac index are poor prognostic indicators. For a patient with NYHA FC IV symptoms, the treatment of choice is IV epoprostenol. It is the only medication with a class I indication for NYHA FC IV PAH, based on the 2013 National Institute for Health Care Excellence guidelines and the 2015 European Society of Cardiology (ESC)/European Respiratory Society (ERS) guidelines, level of evidence grade A. In a clinical trial by Barst et al, epoprostenol was shown to increase six-minute walk distance, and there was a survival benefit seen in patients on therapy (no deaths in the treatment group, but there were 8 deaths out of 40 patients in the placebo group). Epoprostenol is administered as a continuous IV infusion. It has a short half-life (3 to 5 minutes) and requires a pump to ensure delivery. The infusion cannot be interrupted because stopping it can lead to severe rebound pulmonary hypertension, which can be fatal. Inhaled epoprostenol has been proposed as an alternative to inhaled nitric oxide in the ICU. There is no data on the use of inhaled epoprostenol in right heart failure. Treprostinil was initially approved for subcutaneous administration for patients with idiopathic PAH and PAH associated with connective tissue disease. It is also a continuous infusion, but has a longer half-life than epoprostenol. IV treprostinil has been shown to have bioequivalence, but there is no data in NYHA FC IV patients. The 2015 ESC/ERS guidelines give it a Class 2b recommendation, with a level of evidence of C for NYHA FC IV PAH. Ambrisentan and tadalafil are both oral medications approved for treatment of PAH. In the AMBITION study, these agents were shown to have less \u201cclinical worsening events\u201d in NYHA FC II and III patients when started in combination at the time of diagnosis compared to starting either of the medications alone. The combination has not been studied in NYHA FC IV patients. Oral sildenafil has been shown to improve exercise capacity in NYHA FC II and III PAH. It has not been studied in NYHA FC IV PAH. In the 2015 ESC/ERS guidelines, oral sildenafil is given a level 2b recommendation in FC IV PAH, level of evidence C. The IV form was approved in 2009 for continuation of treatment in patients who cannot continue their oral therapy. There is no data on the combination of oral sildenafil and IV sildenafil.

        "correct_answer": "B",
        "rationale": "The right heart does not tolerate the changes that come with surgery and intubation due to the effects on cardiac output (CO) and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR). The right heart is susceptible to increases in PVR. During surgery, hypoxemia, hypercarbia, and acidosis should all be avoided because they can lead to PVR increases. Maintaining the CO and avoiding myocardial depressants is also important. Despite the issues that PAH patients have with surgery, surgery may still be necessary. Managing medications through the perioperative period can be challenging. Some of the effects of prostacyclins are pulmonary vascular vasodilatation, inhibition of platelet aggregation, and antiproliferative effects in the pulmonary circulation. Three prostacyclins are currently approved in the United States, each with different routes of administration: epoprostenol (IV), treprostinil (subcutaneous, inhaled, and oral) and iloprost (inhaled). Epoprostenol is a synthetic prostacyclin and was the first medication approved for treating PAH. It has a very short half-life of 3 to 5 minutes and therefore must be administered by continuous infusion. It is not stable at room temperature and must be kept chilled. A newer version uses a buffer at a different pH that allows better stability at room temperature and therefore chilling is not needed. Because of its short halflife, abrupt discontinuation can lead to severe rebound pulmonary hypertension, which can be fatal. Although prostacyclins have platelet inhibitory effects, they should not be stopped for procedures because of the risk of rebound pulmonary hypertension. Treprostinil is a prostacyclin analog that initially was approved for subcutaneous administration. It has a longer half-life of 4 to 5 hours. IV, inhaled, and oral versions have since been approved. Iloprost is a prostacyclin analog with a short half-life that is administered via nebulization every 2.5 to 3 hours. Sildenafil, a phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitor (PDE5-I), is approved for treating PAH. It works via the nitric oxide pathway. By blocking PDE5, the breakdown of cyclic GMP is inhibited, leading to vasodilation. In clinical trials sildenafil has been shown to increase exercise capacity and improve hemodynamics in patients with PAH. In the PACES study, the combination of epoprostenol and high-dose sildenafil was shown to provide additional benefit compared to epoprostenol alone. An IV version has been approved and can be substituted in patients who are unable to take oral medications. The sildenafil dose is halved when administered intravenously. There is retrospective data to show that warfarin may provide a survival benefit in patients with PAH. The use of warfarin in these patients is recommended. Holding warfarin in this patient is necessary for surgery and can be done safely. Because the surgery is planned for today, the INR will need to be reversed. Postoperatively, a heparin-based therapy can be used until it is safe to restart the warfarin. References: 1. Ortega R, Connor C. Intraoperative management of patients with pulmonary hypertension.

This was confirmed by a subsequent meta-analysis, but it is also known that patients with RV dysfunction and submassive PE have mortality twice that of those without it.

While some patients have frank hemodynamic collapse and cardiac arrest, others have an asymptomatic PE that is discovered incidentally during workup of another condition. When a patient presents with suspected acute PE, initial resuscitative therapy should focus on oxygenation and stabilizion. There are multiple degrees of therapy; the treatment plan should be tailored to the patient relative to the presentation. Resuscitative therapy ranges from supplemental oxygen to ventilator support, hemodynamic support, anticoagulation, and/or fibrinolysis. The use of fibrinolytics in acute PE remains a controversial topic. Most agree that cardiac arrest and haemodynamic instability with systolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg is an indication for thrombolysis. With the increased use of bedside ultrasonography, there is now an aid to diagnosis that may also determine treatment. If a patient is hemodynamically unstable with echocardiographic evidence of right heart dilation and dysfunction, then the next step should be thrombolytic therapy once absolute contraindications have been ruled out. Controversy still exists on appropriate treatment for stable patients with right ventricular dysfunction on echocardiography. This patient has already had two cardiac arrests and is too unstable for confirmatory CT; therefore the initiation of thrombolytics is warranted. References: 1. Fengler BT, Brady WJ.

The BTS guidelines also recommended needle drainage of pneumothoraces and only placement of a chest tube, if needle drainage fails. These recommendations are not supported by a significant amount of evidence, but in this patient the placement of a surgical chest tube by a trainee is questionable. The radiograph causes concern for the surgical chest tube entering the mediastinum. The patient\u2019s fever and tachycardia cause concern for mediastinitis. A CT to locate the chest tube is indicated, and consultation with a thoracic surgeon will possibly be needed. The initial pneumothorax did not resolve because the small-bore chest tube was clogged.

Linezolid is not FDA-approved for S aureus bacteremia. There are no significant data supporting its use for MRSA bacteremia. Patients can develop worsening pancytopenia/thrombocytopenia secondary to linezolid. Linezolid can also interact with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and other drugs that may increase the serotonin level to cause serotonin syndrome. This patient is taking SSRIs and medications that can increase the serotonin level and predispose the patient to a higher risk of serotonin syndrome if linezolid is used. If a strain of Staphylococcus is resistant to oxacillin or methicillin, it is resistant to all \u00df-lactam antibiotics, including penicillins, cephalosporins, and carbapenems. Thus, meropenem, cefepime, and ceftazidime are not active. This resistance is mediated by a change in the bacterial penicillin-binding protein, so \u00df-lactamase inhibitors such as sulbactam, clavulanic acid, and tazobactam have no effect. So piperacillin/tazobactam or ampicillin/sulbactam have no activity. Also, with the patient\u2019s history of anaphylaxis secondary to cephalosporins, caution must be taken when administering penicillins or carbapenems.

Increasing the vancomycin dose to achieve a vancomycin trough closer to 20 \u03bcg/mL would not achieve pharmacokinetic goals because of the high minimum inhibitory concentration of 2 \u03bcg/mL, and it would increase the risk of nephrotoxicity. Daptomycin cannot be used to treat pneumonia because it is bound by surfactant and cannot achieve sufficient concentrations in the respiratory tract.

Many clinicians treat aspiration empirically with antibiotics, but if the patient has aspiration pneumonitis, this is not a recommended practice. Currently, the Syndrome and Aspiration Pneumonia in Intensive Care (SPIRE) study is examining the frequency of bacterial pneumonia in patients admitted to the ICU requiring mechanical ventilation with coma. The elevated procalcitonin level signals that the patient does have a bacterial infection, but it does not have good diagnostic value in differentiating between bacterial aspiration pneumonia and aspiration pneumonitis.

        "rationale": "Funguria is common in patients in the hospital and the ICU, and is usually benign. The most common pathogen is Candida species. Risk factors for funguria include immunosuppression, diabetes, use of broad-spectrum antibacterial agents, use of central venous catheters, malignancy, receipt of parenteral nutrition, urinary tract abnormalities and obstruction, recent urologic procedure, and presence of urinary tract devices. In most cases, patients are asymptomatic, and the candiduria represents contamination or colonization. Usually observation without treatment is all that is required if no predisposing factor is identified. If there is a predisposing factor, then managing that factor, such as removing or replacing the urinary catheter, may be sufficient to eliminate the candiduria, without antifungal therapy. Therefore, antifungal treatment in asymptomatic patients is typically reserved for high-risk patients such as neonates with low birth weight, severely immunocompromised patients, or patients undergoing urinary tract procedures. Colonization is difficult to differentiate from infection based on urinalysis and culture alone, and the patient\u2019s clinical history must be considered. Patients who are symptomatic or who have concerning systemic signs or symptoms (flank pain, hypotension, etc.) should be treated with an antifungal and evaluated for disseminated infection with blood cultures. Because the kidney is the most common organ involved in systemic Candida infections, persistent candiduria should be further evaluated with renal ultrasound or CT to identify localized infection. Furthermore, the skin should be examined for sources such as fungal lesions and evidence of infected vascular access devices. Patients with candidemia should have an ophthalmological examination, regardless of ocular symptoms, to evaluate for endophthalmitis and chorioretinitis. Early ophthalmological examination can aid in the management and reduction of long-term visual deficit. References: 1. Kauffman CA. Diagnosis and management of fungal urinary tract infection.

        "rationale": "The antibiogram is an important tool in the selection of empiric therapy for bacterial infection. It is specific to each hospital; the culture data are derived from patients at the facility who contracted the bacteria. The bacterial isolates are subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing and reporting. In this facility, seven patients had cultured Proteus species when the antibiogram was developed. The susceptibility to amikacin was 71.4%, or five out of seven patients with Proteus species, 57.1% susceptibility to gentamicin, 85.7% susceptibility to piperacillin/tazobactam, and 71.4% susceptibility to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Piperacillin/tazobactam had the highest percentage of susceptibility and should be used as an empiric agent. References: 1. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. Concise Antibiogram Toolkit.

        "rationale": "This is a young patient with progressive neurologic deterioration secondary to a right basal ganglia mass. His clinical picture suggests impending herniation. The CT suggests vasogenic cerebral edema, and the clinical examination with asymmetric pupils suggest that a lumbar puncture may be too risky because it would facilitate further downward transtentorial herniation. The main indication for steroids is vasogenic edema associated with brain tumors or accompanying brain irradiation and surgical manipulation. Although the precise mechanism of the beneficial effects of steroids in this paradigm are unknown, steroids decrease tight-junction permeability and in turn stabilize the disrupted blood-brain barrier. Evidence suggests that therapeutic hypothermia may be considered as an alternative for managing intracranial hypertension in stroke and cardiac arrest, but its use in infectious encephalitis may be harmful. Addition of ampicillin could be considered; however, it will not have any impact on the ensuing transtentorial herniation. Listeria monocytogenes, although an uncommon cause of illness in the general population, is an important pathogen in pregnant women, neonates, elderly people, and immunocompromised people.

These studies also show that adjuvant treatment with antiinflammatory agents, such as dexamethasone, reduces both cerebrospinal fluid inflammation and neurologic sequelae but not overall mortality. Dexamethasone should be administered before or with the first dose of antibiotics to achieve maximal benefit. The recommended dose in adults is 10 mg every six hours, IV, for four days.

        "rationale": "Lemierre syndrome is a potentially fatal form of septic thrombophlebitis of the internal jugular vein (IJV), which frequently affects young, immunocompetent people. It was once rare, but its increasing incidence during the past 20 years is attributed to antibiotic resistance and changes in antibiotic prescription patterns. It typically starts in the palatine tonsils or peritonsillar tissue and spreads into the IJV-containing lateral pharyngeal space, causing septic thrombophlebitis, which is usually followed by distal septic embolization, resulting in multiorgan involvement, with the lung being the most commonly affected site. Other commonly involved sites are joints, muscle, soft tissue, meninges, spleen, and liver. Lemierre syndrome is usually caused by Fusobacterium necrophorum, although a wide variety of bacteria have been reported as causative organisms. Initial clinical presentation can be subtle; sometimes persistent fever is the only prominent symptom. The syndrome is frequently not suspected until microbiologic data is available; hence, a high level of clinical suspicion is needed for timely diagnosis. Physical examination might reveal an exudative tonsillitis or milder form of pharyngitis; however, these oropharyngeal signs might not be evident because the septic thrombophlebitis or metastatic complication usually occurs one to three weeks after the primary infection. Typical signs of IJV thrombophlebitis are pain and swelling along the sternocleidomastoid muscle, but these are found in only approximately half of affected patients. Lemierre syndrome is diagnosed based on the presence of a thrombus in the IJV and positive blood culture. Neck CT with contrast is the diagnostic modality of choice to demonstrate the thrombus. Doppler ultrasonography is an alternative, being less invasive, though also less sensitive, particularly for thrombi located in the area deep to clavicle and mandible, and can miss newly formed thrombus with low echogenicity. A prolonged course of IV antibiotics covering F necrophorum and oral streptococci is the cornerstone of treatment. \u00df-lactamase-producing strains of F necrophorum have been reported; therefore, a \u00df-lactam alone is not recommended. The role of anticoagulation is unclear, but it is generally not indicated unless there is evidence of thrombus expansion. Surgical ligation or excision of the IJV may be necessary in the case of uncontrolled sepsis or septic emboli despite adequate antibiotic treatment. References: 1. Dorfman A, Shokoohi H, Taheri MR.

In the case of a relatively fresh prosthetic valve (less than 12 months), the European Society of Cardiology recommends a regimen of vancomycin and gentamicin, as well as rifampin. Rifampin is a suggested addition because it is thought to sterilize artificial surfaces infected with Staphylococcus aureus. Patients with a surgical indication for removal of infected prosthetic valves have lower sixmonth mortality rates than those treated with only antibiotics. In a prospective study, the most common reason for not undergoing surgery was poor prognosis regardless of treatment, hemodynamic instability, stroke, and sepsis. References: 1.

        "rationale": "This patient has septic shock from acute cholangitis and requires urgent biliary decompression. The treatment of choice is endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). Percutaneous trans-hepatic biliary drainage is another possible nonsurgical method, and may be preferred to ERCP in some situations. In this case, definitive treatment should not be delayed to obtain more imaging; therefore, options A and C are incorrect. Acute cholangitis is a result of bacterial infection superimposed on obstruction of the biliary tree. It is believed that bacteria gain access to the biliary tree by retrograde ascent from the duodenum or from portal venous blood. As a result, infection ascends into the hepatic ducts, causing serious infection. Increased biliary pressure pushes the infection into the biliary canaliculi, hepatic veins, and perihepatic lymphatics, sometimes leading to bacteremia. High biliary pressures caused by obstruction may impair the biliary secretion of antibiotics, so treatment may require decompression and drainage of the biliary system. The most common cause of cholangitis in the United States is choledocholithiasis secondary to cholelithiasis. Less common causes of cholangitis include malignant obstruction, benign strictures, post-procedural cholangitis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis. Rare causes of cholangitis include obstruction from hemobilia, parasites, and hereditary abnormalities of the biliary tree. Of the common complications of gallstones, cholangitis is the most rapidly lethal entity, making accurate diagnosis and early treatment imperative. Mortality rates for patients who fail conservative therapy and do not have appropriate drainage approach 100%. Clinical presentation varies, with 50% to 70% of patients having the classic Charcot triad of fever, abdominal pain, and jaundice. A presentation that also includes altered mental status and hypotension is known as the Reynolds pentad. Diagnosis of ascending cholangitis is usually clinical, although laboratory data and imaging can help distinguish it from other conditions. Typically, laboratory data reveal leukocytosis, hyperbilirubinemia, elevated alkaline phosphatase, and mildly elevated transaminases. Serum amylase may be elevated in up to 30% of patients. Ultrasonography or CT are the most commonly used first-line imaging modalities. Ultrasound is highly sensitive for cholelithiasis but less sensitive (approximately 50%) for choledocholithiasis. Choledocholithiasis may, however, be inferred if there is associated biliary dilation in the presence of cholelithiasis. A normal ultrasound does not rule out cholangitis. MRI and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography are accurate for detecting choledocholithiasis and determining biliary anatomy, but these tests are probably of limited value in acute cholangitis. Initial management of ascending cholangitis consists of fluid resuscitation, correction of electrolyte abnormalities, analgesia, and empiric antibiotics. Blood cultures should be obtained before antibiotic administration, and patients\u2019 status should be nothing-by-mouth. For patients with severe cholangitis, endoscopic drainage has replaced emergency surgical common bile duct exploration and T-tube drainage as standard treatment. This patient will probably need cholecystectomy, but it should be performed after endoscopic treatment of the choledocholithiasis and after resolution of the cholangitis episode. References: 1.

This is defined by one or more of the following criteria being attributable to CDI: admission to ICU for CDI, hypotension with or without required use of vasopressors, fever \u226538.5\u00b0C, ileus or significant abdominal distention, mental status changes, white blood cell count \u226535,000 cells/mm3 or < 2,000 cells/mm3, serum lactate level >2.2 mmol/L, end-organ failure. The clinician should consider the addition of vancomycin per rectum (500 mg in 500 mL saline as enema) four times a day for patients in whom oral antibiotics cannot reach a segment of the colon, such as with Hartman pouch, ileostomy, or colon. Diversion and can be considered in all cases of severe or complicated CDI. In the absence of ileus or significant abdominal distention, oral or enteral feeding should be continued. Supportive care should be provided, including IV fluid resuscitation, electrolyte replacement, and venous thromboembolism prophylaxis. Presumably, the broad-spectrum antibiotics used to treat this patient\u2019s pneumonia have contributed to his CDI, so discontinuing the offending agents or narrowing the antibiotics should also be considered, if possible. Abdominal and pelvic CT can be used as adjuncts to determine the severity and extent of disease and can detect colon wall thickening, ascites, toxic megacolon, ileus, or perforation. Surgical consultation should be considered here as well, since patients who have toxic megacolon or who become clinically unstable due to CDI benefit from urgent total colectomy. This patient is not clinically unstable at this time, and therefore does not have an indication for exploratory laparotomy. Colonoscopy is not indicated in this case because the diagnosis was made based on stool assay, and colonoscopy may put the patient at risk for bowel perforation. For patients with mild to moderate disease (defined as diarrhea plus any additional signs or symptoms not meeting severe or complicated criteria), the treatment is metronidazole, 500 mg orally three times a day for 10 days. If the patient cannot tolerate metronidazole, vancomycin 125 mg orally four times a day for 10 days is indicated.

Even though oral vancomycin is a treatment for C diff colitis, it may still contribute to it. Proton pump inhibitors, such as omeprazole, appear to increase the risk of C diff colitis. None of the other options are known to be associated with C diff colitis. Treatment in critically ill patients consists of enteral and parenteral rectal vancomycin as well as IV metronidazole. Stool transplant has been successful in more severe cases. In the setting of toxic megacolon, preferred management consists of surgical consult and colectomy. References: 1.

        "correct_answer": "D",
        "rationale": "Ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunts are used to treat hydrocephalus, diverting cerebrospinal fluid to another part of the body for reabsorption. The proximal portion of the shunt catheter is most commonly placed in one of the cerebral ventricles; the distal portion of the shunt can be internalized or externalized. Internalized shunts most commonly drain into the peritoneum of the abdomen. The overall infection rate for VP shunts has been reported to be as high as 10%. The highest infection rates have been observed during the first month after initial placement or in patients requiring shunt revisions. This is important because up to 50% of patients will require shunt revision within two years. Early shunt infections most frequently develop via colonization of the shunt with skin flora, presumably related to the recent surgical procedure; staphylococci are the predominant pathogens. Late VP shunt infections (several months after insertion and revision) are usually caused by Streptococcus species and gram-negative pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and occur more commonly as a result of bowel perforation or peritonitis.

        "correct_answer": "D",
        "rationale": "Carbapenem antibiotics play an important role in critical care because they retain activity against gram-negative pathogens that contain cephalosporinases and extended-spectrum \u00df-lactamases. However, the emergence of carbapenemaseproducing bacteria has become a serious threat to public health. Depending on the enzyme, carbapenemase activity may be encoded on chromosomes or plasmids of certain bacteria. Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae, most commonly producing Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC), have become more prevalent in the United States since the early 2000s. The KPC enzyme confers resistance to all \u00df-lactams and, because it resides on transmissible plasmids, it can be transferred from Klebsiella to other bacteria. Carbapenem resistance has also been reported in other gram-negative bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. In addition, several different metallo-\u00df-lactamase-producing strains leading to carbapenem resistance have been identified, including New Delhi metallo-\u00dflactamase, Verona integron-encoded metallo-\u00df-lactamase, and imipenemase metallo\u00df- lactamase. Although more commonly found abroad, these strains have been identified in the United States in patients who have lived or traveled abroad. Contaminated devices may also harbor them. A highly publicized case in 2013 identified transmission of New Delhi metallo-\u00df-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli to many patients after exposure to a single contaminated duodenoscope. Prior use of broad-spectrum cephalosporins or carbapenems is an important risk factor because of the ability for negative strains to acquire genes from other bacteria and become resistant to carbapenems. Additional risk factors include ICU stay, immunosuppression (such as organ transplantation, diabetes, and malignancy), mechanical ventilation, and indwelling catheters. Detection of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae can be challenging because some isolates have minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) that fall slightly below the traditional breakpoints for susceptibility and may not be recognized as carbapenemase producers by the clinical laboratory. In addition to \u00dflactam/ carbapenem resistance, these bacteria often carry genes that confer high levels of resistance to many other antimicrobials, often leaving very limited therapeutic options When culture results identify resistance to any carbapenem or a high MIC, it is prudent to consult an infectious disease specialist for further guidance.

        "rationale": "The emergence of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) is quickly becoming a worldwide problem, especially in hospitalized patients treated with broadspectrum antibiotics, which is a risk factor for it. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that the two most common types of CRE infections, those related to Klebsiella and Escherichia species, cause more than 9,000 healthcareassociated infections per year in the United States. Resistance occurs via the presence of a carbapenem-hydrolyzing \u00df-lactamase (carbapenemase), which is often present on bacterial plasmids or transposons, thereby allowing transmission between bacterial genera. Possession of a carbapenemase typically confers resistance to all \u00df-lactam antibiotics, including those with \u00df-lactamase inhibitors. Also, very high resistance to fluoroquinolones is seen. The mortality rate from CRE infections is extremely high (up to 48%), and treatment is most commonly undertaken with combination therapy, which has been demonstrated to decrease mortality and result in fewer treatment failures compared to monotherapy. The most commonly susceptible antimicrobials are the polymyxins (colistin or polymyxin B), which, depending on in vitro susceptibility testing, are usually combined with fosfomycin, aminoglycosides, tigecycline, or rifampin. Ceftazidime/avibactam, a newer agent recently approved for the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal and urinary tract infections, combines a third-generation cephalosporin with a \u00df-lactamase inhibitor that, unlike the others, has been shown to possess activity against certain classes of carbapenemases. While promising, experience with this drug in treating CRE is still limited. Although these organisms can cause serious infection, asymptomatic intestinal colonization with carbapenemase-producing strains is common and does not necessarily warrant treatment in the absence of clinical infection.

The exact role and timing of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in gallstone pancreatitis has been a topic of debate for years, with many studies finding conservative management equivalent to ERCP intervention in the first 24 to 72 hours after onset. However, this is in the absence of cholangitis and biliary obstruction, for which urgent ERCP is indicated, especially with rapid clinical deterioration. Providing additional IV fluids for severe sepsis secondary to cholangitis is appropriate. However, switching antibiotics, which should provide adequate coverage, less than 24 hours after initiation and not obtaining source control will not improve his condition. Worsening pancreatitis is a known complication of ERCP, but the benefit outweighs the risk in this case, with biliary obstruction and severe sepsis from cholangitis. Guideline recommendations are in favor of ERCP for definitive management compared to placement of a percutaneous trans-hepatic cholangiography tube. This may be considered in a patient who is unable to tolerate ERCP or if ERCP is unavailable. Dialysis may be needed if his clinical condition worsens with associated renal failure, but this is likely to improve once source control is obtained.

        "rationale": "The most widely used scoring system for acute pancreatitis is the Acute Physiologic and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II, but it is cumbersome. The Bedside Index for Severity in Acute Pancreatitis (BISAP) scoring system is validated and easier to calculate. The BISAP score consists of blood urea nitrogen greater than 25, impaired mental status, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, age >60, and pleural effusion. A score of 3 or more shows a significant increase in mortality in patients with acute pancreatitis. The presence of pleural effusion in this patient takes her score from 2 to 3, which increases her 30-day mortality. A chest radiograph also can show presence of pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); it completes the clinical picture. An abdominal CT aids in prognosis and risk stratification regarding necrotizing pancreatitis, but an abdominal ultrasound has already been done. There is no immediate need for an abdominal CT. This patient population has significant inflammatory response, which can mimic septic shock, but they do not routinely need empiric antibiotics. Pancreatitis can be sterile, necrotizing, or infected; these often resemble each other as to clinical picture. In the absence of other confounding factors, the position of both the American College of Gastroenterology and the American Gastroenterology Association is to hold off antibiotics until infection is proven.

Intubation is necessary for any gastrointestinal procedure as is placing a Blakemore tube in the esophagus to avoid exsanguination while awaiting gastroenterology. Often overlooked, but critical to improved outcomes, is antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in cirrhotic patients with variceal hemorrhage. Starting a third-generation IV cephalosporin has been shown to reduce all-cause mortality, infection-related mortality, rebleeding events and hospitalization lengths of stay.

There are four clinical phases of acetaminophen toxicity: phase 1 (0-24 hours): asymptomatic, mild increase in transaminases; phase 2 (18-72 hours): right upper quadrant pain, hypotension; phase 3 (72-96 hours): jaundice, hypoglycemia, coagulopathy; phase 4 (4 days - 3 weeks): recovery. This patient is in phase 1 and there is no indication for intubation or vasopressors because she is still responsive to IV fluids. Naloxone has no role in acetaminophen overdose because patients who take acetaminophen use up their glutathione stores, leading to N-acety- pbenzoquinonimine (NAPQI) excess. Excess NAPQI is further propagated in the hepatic cells, leading to hepatic necrosis. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) replenishes depleted glutathione reserves in the liver and enhances nontoxic metabolism of acetaminophen. Patients with acetaminophen overdose are stratified according to the Rumack-Matthew nomogram; all high-risk patients should be started on NAC therapy, preferably before elevation of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and continued as long as AST does not rise or serum acetaminophen levels are undetectable. If the patient shows signs of hepatic dysfunction or has a massive dose of acetaminophen (>30 g) or serum acetaminophen level greater than 500mg/L, then the patient should be transferred to a liver transplant center for urgent evaluation of possible impending liver failure.

The diagnosis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is made by the presence of more than 250 polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) per mm3 of ascitic fluid. This count, however, must be corrected for the presence of red blood cells (RBCs), the level of which is commonly elevated if the patient has a traumatic paracentesis. The correction factor is a decrease of 1 PMN for every 250 RBCs per mm3 of blood. The most common organisms implicated are Escherichia coli and Klebsiella species. Ascitic and blood cultures should be performed because 50% of SBP cases are associated with bacteremia. Broadspectrum antibiotics are warranted until sensitivities can be obtained. Cefotaxime has the highest rate of resolving infections and minimal side effects. Paracentesis in the critically ill may need to be performed; the use of ultrasound and an experienced operator decreases risk to the patient.

In instances of peptic or duodenal ulcer rebleeding after initial TAE, a subsequent embolization may be performed in patients who fail initial TAE (option C). In 2004, Ripoll et al performed a retrospective analysis of 70 patients who underwent surgery versus TAE for management of refractory upper gastrointestinal bleeding. The study group found no significant difference in rebleeding rate, need for subsequent procedures, or mortality. Additionally, a 2014 meta-analysis of studies comparing TAE to emergency surgery showed increased rebleeding rate among patients who underwent TAE; however, the morbidity rate was equivocal. There is little utility in performing a repeat esophagoduodenoscopy in a patient who failed clipping, epinephrine injections, and initial TAE. A surgical consult should be obtained, but surgery should not be definitive therapy until a second TAE does not control bleeding. Conservative management with transfusion alone is not appropriate because the patient has evidence of severe rebleeding of a known duodenal ulcer, which requires source control. A bleeding scan would not be useful because the source of the bleeding is known. References: 1. Ljungdahl M, Eriksson LG, Nyman R, Gustavsson S.

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are frequently used as part of initial management. Compared with either placebo or H2 blockers, PPI treatment significantly reduces rates of ulcer rebleeding and surgical intervention. A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials of PPI treatment for ulcer bleeding found no significant effect on 30-day all-cause mortality, which was the predetermined primary end point for the clinical trials. Initiation of treatment before endoscopy decreases the stigmata of bleeding seen on endoscopy but has no effect on bleeding, transfusion requirement, need for surgery, or mortality. Although some have recommended pre-endoscopic PPI therapy to downstage the endoscopic lesion, this approach should not delay endoscopy. Endoscopy is a diagnostic and therapeutic intervention and should be done in a time sensitive manner. Pre endoscopic PPI therapy may be most beneficial in instances of delayed early endoscopic treatment or when available endoscopic expertise is limited or suboptimal. Finally, all patients with bleeding peptic ulcers should be tested for H pylori and treated when present with proper follow up to confirm eradication. Reference: 1. Kumar R, Mills AM.

The incidence of central nervous system (CNS) infection secondary to EVDs ranges from 0 to 20% depending on the definition of infection and the study population. Several large studies and meta-analyses estimated incidence of ventriculomeningitis related to EVDs to be between 6% and 8%. Patients with subarachnoid hemorrhages have the highest risk of CNS infection. Duration of EVD catheterization has been implicated in the increased risk of infection, with the majority of infections occurring within the first 10 days after placement. Reinsertion of the EVD, CSF leak from ventriculostomy site, frequent CSF sampling, and neurosurgery are associated with higher risk of CNS infection. Diagnosis of ventriculomeningitis secondary to EVD is based on a combination of clinical signs (fever, headache, meningeal and cranial nerves signs), CSF changes (increased white blood cells and protein, decreased glucose) and bacteriologic findings from CSF. In the settings of traumatic brain injury or neurosurgery, diagnostic criteria are not specific. Early administration of antibiotics is crucial. Most commonly identified pathogens in the cultures from EVD contain skin flora, but recent studies identified increased incidence of infections secondary to gram-negative rods, including Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter. Therefore, initial empiric treatment should be directed to cover methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and gram-negative rods, including Pseudomonas. Gentamicin does not penetrate the blood-brain barrier effectively. Intraventricular antibiotics is a controversial approach and typically reserved for severe or recurrent ventriculomeningitis. The combination of IV vancomycin and cefepime is the optimal choice. References: 1. Stenehjem E, Armstrong WS. Central nervous system device infections.

History is limited but includes psychiatric illness with antipsychotic medication nonadherence. He is intubated to secure his airway and admitted to the ICU. Initial laboratory data reveal: sodium 161 mEq/L, white blood cells 11,500/\u03bcL, blood urea nitrogen 127 mg/dL, hemoglobin 17.1 g/dL, creatinine 2.8 mg/dL. Toxicology screen is negative. Head CT reveals no acute pathology. During the course of the following week, he is hydrated; his acute renal failure and hypernatremia resolve, but he remains neurologically impaired. His eyes open but there is no visual pursuit. He is adynamic in bed, and extremities are flaccid. Further neurologic testing is performed. An EEG shows a nonspecific pattern of electrical activity, with no epileptic activity. Lumbar puncture shows white blood cells 0, glucose 80 mg/dL, protein 42 g/L.

        "correct_answer": "E",
        "rationale": "Osmotic demyelination involving the pons has long been recognized as a complication of the management of hyponatremia manifesting as coma and spastic quadriparesis in its most severe form. However, more recently it has been recognized that other osmotic disorders, such as hypernatremia, hyperglycemia, and hypoglycemia may predispose a patient to myelinolysis in the course of treatment. Furthermore, it has been recognized that the spectrum of injury is broadly manifested as either pontine myelinolysis or extra-pontine myelinolysis. The disorder has therefore been renamed osmotic demyelination syndrome in order to recognize the full spectrum of disease. The patient\u2019s toxicology screen is nonrevealing, and history indicates that he was nonadherent with his medications, making a drug-related toxic encephalopathy less likely. Cerebrospinal fluid revealed no evidence of inflammation, making infectious meningoencephalitis unlikely and, similarly, anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis (an autoimmune disorder to cerebral NMDA receptors) unlikely. Malignant catatonia, which is common in psychotic patients, is associated with toxicity in the form of autonomic dysregulation and muscular rigidity not seen in this patient. References: 1.

Which of the following is the most definitive course of action?",
        "correct_answer": "D",
        "rationale": "This patient has a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), with early evidence of hydrocephalus. SAH is associated with high morbidity and mortality. There are multiple associated complications that are highly dependent on timing from aneurysm rupture. During the first three days, and before the aneurysm is secured, three major complications should be evaluated: rebleeding, acute hydrocephalus, and seizures or nonconvulsive status epilepticus. The head CT did not show increased hemorrhage but did show an increase in the size of the temporal horns of the ventricular system. This is concerning for hydrocephalus. Along with the decreased mental status, these findings are concerning for elevated intracranial pressure (ICP), so a monitor should be placed to control ICP and maintain adequate cerebral perfusion pressure. There are two ways to measure ICP. One is an intraparenchymal monitor, sometimes colloquially referred to as a \u201cbolt,\u201d that will measure ICP but will not allow cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) removal, so it is less than ideal. Following the Monro-Kellie hypothesis, increased CSF and blood volume will increase ICP when all compensatory mechanisms are exhausted. The other and most appropriate treatment to manage elevated ICP in this patient is to remove CSF in a controlled fashion, then divert further CSF with a temporary drain. This is best accomplished by an external ventricular drain inserted into a lateral ventricle, which can remove CSF and treat the hydrocephalus. CSF should be removed slowly and in a controlled fashion because of the theoretical concern about aneurysm re-rupture when the external forces compressing the artery are removed. Seizures are an important source of morbidity, but in this patient with acute hydrocephalus, ICP should be managed first. Reference: 1. Edlow JA, Samuels O, Smith WS, Weingart SD.

Only after all potential confounders have been eliminated should brain death testing proceed.

        "correct_answer": "B",
        "rationale": "Endocrine deficiencies are common after brain death because the hypothalamus and pituitary gland are susceptible to hypoxic injury in the face of elevated intracranial pressure leading to the absence of blood flow to the brain. Not only is vasopressin of value in managing diabetes insipidus, which is common with brain death, but it also serves as a first-line agent in the management of hypotension due to vasodilation. High-dose corticosteroids are believed to reduce the injurious effects of systemic inflammation activated in the course of brain death, and therapy has been associated with improved organ function post-transplant. Thyroid replacement is particularly useful in managing donors who are hemodynamically unstable or who have cardiac dysfunction that demonstrates a left ventricular ejection fraction less than 45%. While triiodothyronine has a more rapid onset of activity, the use of either has demonstrated equivalent effectiveness. Hyperglycemia is common in brain-dead donors with the same inherent metabolic consequences as in typical ICU patients. While there are no specific studies involving glycemic control in this population, there is evidence that hyperglycemia impacts the function of donated organs. The literature guiding glycemic control in typical critically ill patients has therefore been extrapolated to the care of potential organ donors. Therefore, management should comply with local ICU hyperglycemia guidelines and protocols. Reference: 1.

Decisions regarding hemodynamic support reflect the attempt to balance the effects of interventions to achieve the maximal ability to procure all possible organs. The brain-dead donor is frequently hypovolemic due to vasodilation with relative hypovolemia and fluid losses from injury with blood loss and polyuria from diabetes insipidus as well as capillary leak from systemic inflammation. Fluid therapy should be administered with the guidance of hemodynamic parameters to achieve euvolemia. The lungs are particularly sensitive to fluid fluxes. Fluids, which can be administered as crystalloids or colloids or combinations of both, should be given to achieve reasonable organ perfusion pressure and a urine flow of \u22651 mL/kg/hr. Of crystalloids, normal saline and lactated Ringer solution are generally preferred. It is recommended that routine use of dextrose-containing fluids be avoided. Colloids (except for hetastarch, which has come under scrutiny because of its association with renal injury in critically ill ICU patients) are as acceptable as crystalloids. Reference: 1.

The roles of hypothermia, hemicraniectomy, and ICP monitoring in traumatic brain injury (TBI) were recently challenged by three prospective randomized controlled trials. In the EuroTHERM study, patients received IV pentobarbital versus a regimen of hypothermia for refractory intracranial hypertension. The hypothermic group had worse long-term outcomes overall. The study was criticized because hypothermic patients did not receive hyperosmolar or hypertonic saline before randomization, amounting to a degree of selection bias. In the DECRA study, patients with severe TBI were randomized to medical therapy versus bifrontal hemicraniectomies. The surgical group had worse long-term outcomes. The study was criticized because patients in the surgical group may have had transtensorial herniation before randomization (abnormal cranial nerves or pupillary reflexes). Finally, in the BEST-TRIP study, patients with severe TBI in South America were randomized to ICP monitoring versus a regimen of clinical monitoring. There was no difference in outcomes between groups. The study was criticized because of differences in population and healthcare systems, which make it difficult to generalize results to more advanced healthcare systems in which pre- and posthospital care may be more aggressive.

His physical examination reveals an initial Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 7: no eye opening (E1), incomprehensible sounds (V2), flexion/withdrawal from pain (M4). In the ICU, his GCS would be described as 6T: no eye opening (E1), intubated (V1T), flexion/withdrawal from pain (M4). The most recent Brain Trauma Foundation (BTF) guidelines from 2007 recommend intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring after TBI for the following patients: 1) GCS 3-8 with abnormal CT (hematoma, contusion, swelling, herniation, or compressed basal cistern), 2) GCS 3-8 with normal CT if greater than or equal to 2 of the following are present: age greater than 40 years, unilateral or bilateral motor posturing, and SBP less than 90. In the recent BEST-TRIP study by Chestnut et al, the role of ICP monitoring in patients with severe TBI was evaluated against a protocol of imaging and clinical examination (ICE). This multicenter randomized trial showed that the use of the previously unstudied ICE in a hospital with limited economic resources that lacks ICP monitoring may lead to non-inferior clinical outcomes, compared to the BTF guidelines-driven control of ICP using ICP monitoring. General consensus and the BTF guidelines still recommend the use of ICP monitoring after severe TBI. Continuous EEG monitoring currently is not indicated for routine TBI management, but should be used when seizures are suspected (i.e., obvious clinical seizures, encephalopathy, coma/stupor, or when clinical examination is worse than head CT findings). However, seizures in comatose patients may be more common than previously thought. Claassen et al detected seizures in 19% of critically ill patients on continuous EEG. In their subgroup of 51 patients with TBI, 9 (18%) had nonconvulsive status epilepticus. Low brain tissue oxygenation levels have been associated with worse outcomes after TBI; however, its role in management remains experimental at this time. References: 1.

Differential diagnosis includes recurrent intracranial bleeding, cerebral edema, electrolyte abnormalities, alcohol withdrawal, and infection. While a repeat CT should be performed to rule out worsening cerebral edema or recurrent bleeding, it would be reasonable to control his agitation and evaluate his electrolytes first. If there is evidence of hyponatremia and/or cerebral edema, a bolus of hypertonic saline may be indicated, but unless there are acute signs of cerebral herniation (dilated pupil, Cushing reflex), it would be best to check the electrolytes first. Alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) is characterized by tachycardia, hypertension, fever, agitation, diaphoresis, tremor, and delirium. These signs and symptoms usually manifest within 48-96 hours after the patient\u2019s last drink, and can progress to delirium tremens and seizures if not treated promptly. The mainstay of treatment for acute signs of AWS is a benzodiazepine, such as lorazepam. Any patient in whom AWS is suspected should also be given thiamine and folate. After the acute symptoms are controlled, a thorough workup, including complete blood count, chemistries, blood cultures, and imaging, should be performed to rule out other etiologies. Reference: 1.

The use of steroids in acute spinal cord injury is also debatable on the basis of the most recent NASCIS III study, which showed no outcome effect. In 2013, based on the available evidence, the American Association of Neurological Surgeons and Congress of Neurological Surgeons stated that the use of glucocorticoids in acute spinal cord injury is not recommended.

Central pontine myelinolysis is described as a noninflammatory osmotic demyelination of the central basis pontis. It is thought to occur more frequently in severe hyponatremia of 120 mEq/L or less, which is not the case for this patient. He has hyponatremia; however, when accounting for hyperglycemia, his corrected sodium is 133-136 mEq/dL, depending on the correction formula used. Hypoactive delirium is characterized as decreased alertness with slow movements, lethargy, sparse speech, and apathy. He has cerebral edema from rapid correction of glucose and rehydration, which is common after treatment for DKA. His symptoms have degenerated from stupor to coma. The mechanism remains unclear but may be explained on the basis of neuronal adaptation to hyperosmolar states and rapid correction of the blood osmolarity. In this case, neurons would lose interstitial free water to equalize the osmolarity across membranes. With rapid correction, water moves from the cerebrospinal fluid and blood into the brain (thereby increasing the interstitial volume) and to the uptake of solutes by the cells (thereby pulling water into the cells and restoring the cell volume). Treatment ranges from supportive care for mild symptoms to hypertonic solutions and loop diuretics. References: 1. Stagno D, Gibson C, Breitbart W.

An undesirable sequelae of these agents is residual neuromuscular blockade, which is due to incomplete metabolism and excretion of the drugs at the end of surgery, which can be influenced by a number of factors, including fluid and electrolyte imbalances, hepatic and renal dysfunction, hypothermia, drug interactions, and preexisting neurologic disease. Train-of-four (TOF) peripheral nerve stimulation is the primary qualitative method used for assessment of neuromuscular blockade; it involves administering four supramaximal electrical impulses every 0.5 seconds to the ulnar, facial, or posterior tibial nerve. In the absence of neuromuscular blockade, TOF stimulation produces four muscle twitches from the associated muscles that are innervated by the stimulated nerve. Fade of the twitch response occurs with increasing neuromuscular blockade and can be evaluated by comparing the strength (TOF ratio) of the fourth twitch to that of the first twitch. TOF testing in this patient is consistent with deep pharmacologic paralysis due to rocuronium. Reversal of the deep neuromuscular blockade is therefore necessary to assess his neurologic examination. Neostigmine is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor commonly used to reverse nondepolarizing neuromuscular blockade at the end of surgery. Glycoprryolate is also administered to blunt the muscarinic effects of neostigmine. Neostigmine will reverse all nondepolarizing neuromuscular blockers. Sugammadex will reverse rocuronium and vecuronium, but is ineffective at reversing cisatricurium. Sugammadex is the first of a new class of drugs effective for reversing the aminosteroid neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) (rocuronium, vecuronium and pancuronium) but it does not reverse cisatracurium. Reversal of the neuromuscular blockade by sugammadex consists of two phases. First, sugammadex encapsulates, and thereby inactivates, the NMBA molecules in the plasma, resulting in the rapid reduction of free molecules. The subsequent drop in plasma NMBA concentration produces a concentration gradient that allows for more NMBA to move from the neuromuscular junction into plasma. The sugammadex-NMBA complex is eliminated via the kidneys. It is important to note that reversal by sugammadex is independent of the degree of neuromuscular blockade. In practice, this allows even deep neuromuscular blockade to be predictably and reliably reversed. References: 1. Brull SJ, Murphy GS. Residual neuromuscular block: lessons unlearned.

        "correct_answer": "C",
        "rationale": "Acute respiratory failure is the most common reason for ICU admission following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). As the incidence of infectious complications of HSCT has diminished as a result of effective antimicrobial prophylaxis, noninfectious pulmonary insults have emerged as a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Several acute lung injury syndromes (idiopathic pneumonia syndrome, engraftment syndrome, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage) are now well characterized. Although they have somewhat similar clinical features, distinguishing between them is important for initiating appropriate treatment and for prognosticating outcome. Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) usually presents within the first month after HSCT. Risk factors for DAH are intensive chemotherapy before HSCT, total body irradiation, older age, white blood cell count recovery, severe mucositis, and renal insufficiency. Patients typically present with dyspnea, nonproductive cough, fever, and diffuse pulmonary infiltrates. Hemoptysis is rare. Chest radiograph shows bilateral interstitial and alveolar infiltrates that tend to be perihilar and in the lower lobes. These radiologic findings may precede the clinical presentation by an average of three days. High-resolution chest CT shows bilateral ground glass infiltrates. Demonstration of progressively bloodier return from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) in the absence of an identifiable respiratory tract infection is considered a key diagnostic feature. However, in one study, more than half of patients with autopsy-proven DAH had non-bloody BAL fluid. The presence of more than 20% hemosiderin-laden macrophages in BAL fluid is an alternative diagnostic criterion, but because it may take 48 to 72 hours for this to appear, the absence of hemosiderin does not exclude a fresh bleeding episode. Treatment consists of high-dose systemic corticosteroids, although there are no prospective randomized studies to confirm the benefit of this treatment in HSCT recipients. Although thrombocytopenia is common in HSCT patients, platelet transfusion does not result in improvement in respiratory status. Death is usually a result of sepsis or multisystem organ failure rather than respiratory failure from refractory hemorrhage. Bronchiolitis obliterans is an inflammatory disease of the small airways that develops late in the course of HSCT. It leads to progressive obstructive airway disease without parenchymal involvement. Bronchiolitis obliterans gradually progresses over months to years, and patients eventually die of respiratory failure. Systemic corticosteroids are not typically beneficial. Chronic therapy with macrolides may slow its progression. Engraftment syndrome is characterized by fever, erythrodermatous rash, and noncardiogenic pulmonary edema that occurs during the neutrophil recovery phase of HSCT. Although the syndrome\u2019s etiology is poorly understood, the release of proinflammatory cytokines during engraftment is thought to play a primary role. The administration of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor may increase the incidence and severity of engraftment syndrome. Discontinuation of this agent is recommended for patients who develop this complication. For patients with significant pulmonary involvement, corticosteroid administration has been recommended, although mortality is high among those who progress to respiratory failure. Acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a common complication of HSCT that is an exaggerated but otherwise normal response of donor immune cells to host antigens. Clinically GVHD manifests as injury to the skin, gastrointestinal mucosa, and liver that occurs in two general scenarios: classic, occurring within the first 100 days after HSCT; or late onset, occurring after 100 days. The diagnosis of acute GVHD is based on a combination of clinical and biopsy findings. Glucocorticoids are the gold standard for GVHD treatment. Other treatments include immunosuppressants such as cyclosporine or mycophenolate mofetil, IV immunoglobulin, and occasionally extracorporeal phototherapy. Gastrointestinal involvement may necessitate parenteral nutrition to rest the gut. Octreotide may be useful for severe diarrhea. Mortality is usually secondary to sepsis rather than a direct result of GVHD. References: 1. Afessa B, Azoulay E. Critical care of the hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipient.

        "correct_answer": "D",
        "rationale": "Argatroban is incorrect. Application of pretest probability assessment using the 4Ts scoring system reveals that timing is not consistent with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) since the onset was after a trending of platelet fall observed before initiation of low-molecular-weight heparin four days before (0 points). Although the degree of platelet fall (greater than 50%) assigns 2 points, there are other definite reasons for thrombocytopenia (piperacillin/tazobactam, smoldering infection) (0 points) and no evidence of a new thrombosis (0 points). Therefore, the total 4Ts score is 2, which denotes low probability and is driven solely by the degree of platelet fall. Although this scoring system may not be completely reliable in identifying risk in critically ill patients, the disparity is caused by lack of knowledge regarding previous heparin exposure as well as alternative causes of HIT. The patient has no prior heparin exposure, and has other possible reasons for thrombocytopenia. Because of this (initiation of alternate anticoagulation is recommended with moderate to high pretest probability) along with a platelet count below 50 x 103/mm3 (major bleeding risk factor) and previous bleeding, therapeutic anticoagulation with argatroban would bring more risk than benefit. Aspirin is incorrect because the current platelet level puts him at a high risk of bleeding. Fondaparinux is incorrect because it is contraindicated for a platelet count below 50 x 103/mm3. Mechanical prophylaxis is correct. His low platelet count, below 50 x 103/mm3 (major bleeding risk factor) and previous bleeding substantiates stopping pharmacologic prophylaxis and initiating mechanical methods until platelet count improves.

        "correct_answer": "B",
        "rationale": "Multiple units of blood products were given as part of resuscitation. The typical life span of a red blood cell (RBC) is approximately 120 days, but stored RBCs have significantly shorter life spans due to oxidative damage to RBC membranes; this leads to decreased plasticity and deformability with subsequent hemolysis. More than 20% of packed RBCs are destroyed within 24 hours after transfusion, with the average life span of transfused packed RBCs being only 90 days. In addition, the patient has upregulation of inflammatory cytokines (interleukin[IL]-1 and tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-\u03b1]) as result of the trauma, which leads to increased vulnerability to oxidative stress and decrease in deformability. One mechanism is probably related to the direct damaging effects of reactive oxygen species from activated phagocytes on RBC membrane proteins. Increased concentrations of nitric oxide and increased intracellular concentration of calcium decrease the deformability of RBCs and might predispose to intravascular hemolysis. Most of the iron in the body recirculates as old RBCs die, heme is metabolized, and iron is reused for erythropoiesis. Hepcidin plays a key role in iron metabolism, regulating the movement of iron into plasma. Expression of hepcidin leads to intracellular retention of iron. Hepcidin transcription is repressed by iron deficiency and hypoxia. Release of proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, leads to activation of hepcidin synthesis and suppression of iron metabolism. In this patient, the proinflammatory state is likely to affect iron metabolism; however, the acute drop in hemoglobin concentration is probably not secondary to impaired erythropoiesis. Critical illness and trauma affect erythropoietin metabolism in several ways. First, concentration of erythropoietin in the blood of patients with critical illness or trauma is disproportionally low compared to the level of anemia. It produces suppressive effects of IL-1b and TNF-\u03b1 on erythropoietin. In addition, inflammatory cytokines produce direct suppressive effects on erythroid colony formation. Administration of recombinant erythropoietin in critical illness has produced conflicting results in terms of amount of transfused packed RBCs, while increasing the survival in the subgroup of trauma patients. In this patient, the acute drop in hemoglobin concentration is unlikely due to decreased erythropoiesis. References: 1. Singh S, Gudzenko V, Fink MP. Pathophysiology of perioperative anaemia.

        "rationale": "Anaphylaxis can occur as a result of an immune-mediated reaction or direct nonimmune- mediated reaction. Immunologic anaphylaxis occurs following an initial sensitization. A second exposure generates an immune-mediated (most commonly IgE-mediated) reaction resulting in the release of inflammatory mediators from mast cells and basophils. Common perioperative medications/exposures causing immunologic anaphylaxis include neuromuscular blocking drugs (NMBDs), antibiotics, and latex. Non-immunologic anaphylaxis occurs after the direct activation of mast cells and basophils, without immunologic involvement. This may occur on first exposure rather than requiring a prerequisite exposure for sensitization. Common examples include vancomycin, morphine, and cold temperature exposure. Any agent that can generate a non-immunologic reaction also has the potential to generate an immune-mediated reaction. Relapse of anaphylaxis may occur up to 72 hours (median 11 hours) after the initial event, and has been reported in 1-20% of patients. The mechanism is not clearly understood, but may be caused by decreased plasma concentrations of anaphylaxis medications or a true immunologic phenomenon.

HIT is characterized by a decrease in platelet count of more than 50% from the highest platelet count after heparin is started, an onset of five to 10 days after heparin is started, hypercoagulability, and the presence of heparindependent, platelet-activating IgG antibodies. The next step in confirming the diagnosis is to test the blood for platelet factor 4-heparin antibodies. Although enzyme immunoassays to detect these antibodies have a high negative predictive value, they have a low positive predictive value and thus should only be performed if clinical suspicion for HIT is high, as it is for this patient. Platelet factor 4-heparin antibodies activate platelets to increase thrombin generation; therefore, patients with HIT are at increased risk for thrombosis and should be anticoagulated. However, anticoagulation with heparin, low-molecular-weight heparin, or warfarin are all contraindicated. The most appropriate treatment is direct thrombin inhibition with an argatroban infusion.

        "rationale": "This patient has septic shock from a urinary source, and she has developed disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), as evidenced by elevation in coagulation factors, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia with schistocytes, and thrombocytopenia. DIC causes dysfunction in the blood coagulation system, resulting in the abnormal deposition of fibrin, causing microvascular thrombi and contributing to multiorgan failure. Patients have thrombosis or severe bleeding. DIC in the setting of purpura fulminans has a mortality rate of 18%; the presence of DIC is an independent predictor of mortality in patients with sepsis. Sepsis is the most frequent cause of DIC in the ICU. Common organisms implicated in its pathogenesis include Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Even though this patient\u2019s blood smear has schistocytes, she does not have any other clinical manifestations of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), including altered mental status or renal failure. Although all five classical findings of TTP are not found in a majority of patients, TTP patients do not have abnormal coagulation tests. IV immunoglobulin has no role in this patient\u2019s management. According to the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis, patients can have overt or non-overt DIC, based on this scoring system and management algorithm: 1) Platelet count. 50,000-100,000 per mm3 (1 point), less than 50,000 per mm3 (2 points); 2) Elevated d-dimer, fibrin degradation products. No increase (0 points), moderate increase (2 points), strong increase (3 points); 3) Prolonged prothrombin time. Less than 3 sec (0 points), 3-6 sec (1 point), greater than or equal to 6 sec (2 points); 4) Fibrinogen. Greater than or equal to 1g/L (0 points), less than or equal to 1g/L (1 point). Total score of greater than 5 points means overt DIC, for which coagulation studies should be repeated at least daily. Total score of less than 5 points means non-overt DIC, for which coagulation studies and scoring should be repeated within 1 to 2 days. Current guidelines do not recommend the replacement of blood products in patients who are not actively bleeding. Therefore, the correct management in this patient is observation with repeat coagulation studies in 1 to 2 days. References: 1. Levi M, Toh CH, Thachil J, Watson HG.

Pertinent laboratory findings are: hemoglobin 11.5 g/dL, platelets 50,000/mm3, INR 3.1. Which of the following tests is most likely to be helpful in differentiating coagulopathy of chronic liver disease from disseminated intravascular coagulation?",
        "correct_answer": "C",
        "rationale": "Liver disease can lead to derangements in coagulation and platelet function. The liver is the main site for synthesis of fibrinogen and factors II, V, VII, IX, X, XI, and XII. It is also the site of vitamin K-dependent gamma-carboxylation of factors II, VII, IX and X. In some instances, it may be difficult to differentiate coagulopathy of chronic liver disease from disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), especially in the setting of septic shock. In this case, a factor VIII level would be helpful. Factor VIII is synthesized primarily in the endothelium and is usually normal or increased in acute or chronic liver failure. However, factor VIII levels are significantly decreased in DIC. Fibrinogen and factor V would be decreased in both DIC and chronic liver disease with coagulopathy. Similarly, bleeding time and partial thromboplastin time would be elevated, hence less helpful in distinguishing between the two disorders. Thrombocytopenia can be present in chronic liver disease as a result of portal hypertension and sequestration of platelets into the spleen. While patients may have laboratory abnormalities that would raise concern for increased risk of bleeding, patients with cirrhosis also have an equivalent decrease in anticoagulant factors, including protein C, protein S, and plasminogen. These patients are not auto-anticoagulated. In fact, portal vein thrombosis can complicate chronic liver disease in as many as 15% of cases. The administration of blood products is therefore reserved for patients with coagulopathy and active bleeding. Empiric administration of blood, fresh frozen plasma, or platelets can increase portal venous pressures and may increase risk of variceal hemorrhage or thrombosis. Therefore, the correct management in this patient is observation. References: 1. Hunt BJ. Bleeding and coagulopathies in critical care. N Engl J Med. 2014 Feb 27;370(9):847-859. 2.

        "correct_answer": "D",
        "rationale": "This case illustrates important concepts about the variability in presentation of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). TTP is an acquired hematologic disorder in which there is qualitative or quantitative deficit in ADAMTS13 (a metalloprotease responsible for cleaving von Willebrand factor), leading to widespread thrombus formation, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and platelet consumption. TTP carries almost 100% mortality if untreated. It is most frequently seen in young adults; patients can present with nonspecific symptoms including headache, confusion, abdominal pain, and nausea. Furthermore, it is important to recognize that patients may not be critically ill on presentation. In addition, although TTP is classically associated with a pentad of renal failure, high fever, altered mental status, thrombocytopenia, and hemolytic anemia, these clinical manifestations are seldom all seen together. In fact, acute kidney injury and renal failure is less common in TTP than nonspecific gastrointestinal symptoms and mild to moderate central nervous system disturbances. TTP is ultimately a clinical diagnosis; prompt treatment (within four to eight hours of presentation) should be administered when there is clinical suspicion. The mainstay in TTP treatment is plasma exchange. This is often combined with either corticosteroids (usually pulse dose methylprednisolone, 1 mg/kg/day IV for three days) or rituximab, which has been known to decrease the duration of plasma exchange. Plasma exchange should be continued until the platelet count reaches greater than or equal to 50,000/mm3 for at least 48 hours, while continuing corticosteroids. If there is no sign of relapse and platelet count remains greater than or equal to 150,000/mm3, central venous catheters can be removed and corticosteroids tapered. Platelet transfusion in TTP is contraindicated because it can worsen thrombotic microangiopathy. Furthermore, these patients are generally at higher risk of thrombotic complications versus bleeding. Plasmapheresis has no role in the management of TTP, since it is not thought to be antibody mediated. References: 1.

Many clinicians have adopted a transfusion ratio of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) to PRBCs of 1:1 or 1:2, based on retrospective studies of military and civilian casualties. Massive transfusion strategies have been associated with less organ dysfunction, more ventilator-free days, and less abdominal compartment syndrome. The use of FFP is not without risk; there is a documented increased risk of transfusion-associated acute lung injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and multiple organ dysfunction. There is currently no consensus guideline on the use of FFP after repeated red cell transfusions.

Factor VII deficiency is an autosomal recessive disease that occurs in 1 in 300,000 to 1 in 500,000 and is associated with increased bleeding. Factor VII deficiency would result in a prolonged prothrombin time but not activated partial thrombin time (aPTT). Factor VIII deficiency, an X-linked recessive trait, results in a prolonged aPTT. Depending on the severity, patients can present with severe internal and external bleeding. Factor XI deficiency is responsible for hemophilia C, which can affect both sexes and occurs predominantly in Ashkenazi Jews. Spontaneous hemorrhage is atypical, and excessive bleeding occurs in the setting of trauma or surgery. Its deficiency results in a prolonged aPTT. In vitro, factor XII initiates the intrinsic coagulation pathway through contact activation with negatively charged surfaces. Its activity is one of the factors measured by aPTT. Factor XII\u2019s role in vivo is the promotion of fibrinolysis by activation of plasminogen activator. Factor XII deficiency results in a prolonged aPTT, but instead of being associated with increased bleeding, it has been implicated in major thromboembolic events and retinal vein occlusions.

Prophylactic antibiotic administration has a potential therapeutic role. What must be determined is the time period during which contamination of the abdominal cavity becomes an established infection.

A meta-analysis reviewed 17 studies assessing the effectiveness of single-agent versus combination therapy containing aminoglycosides for penetrating wounds. It was determined that single \u00df-lactam agents were as effective as combination therapy. Prophylactic antibiotics are required for only 24 hours in the presence of injury to any hollow viscus. Delgado et al compared the duration of antibiotics after penetrating abdominal wounds associated with a bowel injury and rates of infections. Although retrospective, the authors concluded that there was no reduction in infection rates when antibiotics were administered for longer than 24 hours (18 of 76 vs. 3 of 21; p = 0.278). Patients with risk factors for postoperative complications were defined as those who had two or more units of blood transfused, penetrating abdominal trauma score greater than or equal to 12, or operative time exceeding two hours. Furthermore, patients were stratified according to high and low risk for infection. In the 78 low-risk patients, there was no difference in infection rates when antimicrobials were stopped after 24 hours. References: 1.

Consideration of tranexamic acid is warranted, given the severity of the injury and the early arrival to the trauma center after the accident.

        "rationale": "Thromboelastography (TEG) has become increasingly common in the management of trauma patients. Compared to static laboratory measurements of clotting factors (prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, INR, platelet count), TEG provides a more rapid and dynamic assessment of whole blood coagulation. This allows for a global assessment of hemostatic function and can facilitate timely intervention. Although no formal trials have demonstrated statistical benefits of TEG in trauma patients, many trauma centers have nonetheless adopted its use. Many patients sustaining trauma take some type of blood-thinning medication for various reasons. This information is often not known to medical providers. In this patient, with a subdural hematoma and Glasgow Coma Scale score of 8, rapid reversal of the anticoagulant is necessary to achieve the best possible outcome. Compared to the reference, the R time is prolonged, meaning that he is deficient in clotting factors. Fresh frozen plasma or prothrombin complex concentrate may help to reverse this, keeping in mind that some novel anticoagulants may still not respond to these treatments. The alpha angle and maximum amplitude are within normal limits, so he should not need cryoprecipitate or platelets. Finally, there is no evidence of fibrinolysis requiring the use of tranexamic acid.

She is hypotensive, but fluid responsive. Her lungs are evaluated via ultrasonography as part of an extended focused assessment with sonography in trauma (eFAST) examination. Which of the following findings on ultrasonography is most indicative of pneumothorax?",
        "correct_answer": "C",
        "rationale": "Normal lungs demonstrate a back-and-forth movement of the pleural line (movement of the visceral pleura along the parietal pleura) between the rib spaces. In a pneumothorax, air separates the visceral and parietal pleura. This prevents visualization of the parietal pleural because air has high acoustic impedance and, as a result, lung sliding is absent. Using M-mode sonography, the normal seashore appearance is lost and depicts a barcode appearance. See Figure 1, shown below. Panel A shows the granular seashore appearance of normal lung sliding. Panel B shows the horizontal barcode appearance that occurs with loss of lung sliding. B lines, also called comet tail artifacts, are normal reverberation artifacts that appear as hyperechoic vertical lines extending from the pleura to the bottom of the display screen image. See Figure 2, shown below. These artifacts move with lung sliding and are expected in normal aerated lungs; their presence suggests that a pneumothorax is unlikely. A lines are normal reverberation artifacts that occur from sound waves reflecting off the lung pleura. See Figure 3, shown below. They appear as equally spaced repetitive horizontal lines throughout the lung image. Normally, B lines extend from the pleural line and erase A lines, because they emanate out to the edge of the image. In a pneumothorax, air in the pleural space results in a high acoustic impedance, preventing the passage of ultrasound waves, although A lines continue to be present, but B lines are lost. Lung point describes the location at which the interface between the lung visceral and parietal pleura is disrupted due to the presence of air. This is appreciated in a pneumothorax when moving the ultrasound probe in a medial-to-lateral direction, from the anterior to lateral chest wall, and observing lung sliding in one area and loss of lung sliding in another. Free air is not a sign of pneumothorax because air is difficult to see in ultrasound and causes difficult ultrasonographic windows. Figure 1. Lung sliding on M-mode sonography P = pleura. Figure 2.

The most prudent strategy is to combine the entire clinical picture with multiple markers of hypoperfusion, to include vital signs, physical examination, urine output, lactate, base deficit, mixed venous oxygen saturation, etc., while weighing the risk-to-benefit analysis of ongoing fluid and product administration (eg, potential for worsening oxygenation or abdominal compartment syndrome). Base deficit has been studied in the trauma population, with a correlation to outcome. However, this data is not robust, and no specific threshold level or correction time frame can be reported with any confidence.

Normal intra-abdominal pressure is 5 to 7 mm Hg and should be measured at end-expiration, in the supine position, absent of abdominal muscle contraction, with a zeroed transducer at the level of the mid-axillary line. Intra-abdominal hypertension can exist without abdominal compartment syndrome, in such conditions as morbid obesity and ascites. Abdominal compartment syndrome is the presence of intra-abdominal hypertension (>20 mm Hg) associated with new or worsening organ dysfunction. Abdominal compartment syndrome can affect most all organ systems. This patient has some of the classic findings. Central venous pressure will be elevated. Due to a reduction in compliance, both peak and plateau airway pressures will increase, and ventilation will become increasingly difficult. Of note, an elevated peak airway pressure and normal plateau pressure would indicate a resistance problem, such as endotracheal tube occlusion or bronchoconstriction. Due to a reduction in perfusion pressure to the kidney, oliguria will occur. When bladder pressure is normal, other causes for deterioration should be sought, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome with concomitant acute cor pulmonale. References: 1.

        "rationale": "The primary cause of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) type II is the development of antibodies to heparin-platelet factor 4. Patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) are exposed to a large heparin bolus during surgery, but less than 3% of patients undergoing CPB develop HIT. Thrombocytopenia after cardiac surgery is primarily due to mechanical destruction of platelets on the bypass circuit, as well as the hemodilution that occurs while on bypass. The platelet nadir after CPB is two to three days postoperatively, which is where this patient is. The platelet count typically drops by 30% in patients who underwent CPB. The most likely cause of his platelet count drop is CPB, based on the timing and degree of decrease. HIT must be considered, but it is unlikely because his platelet count drop is not 50% or greater. In HIT patients, the decrease in platelet count typically begins five to 14 days after starting heparin. Furthermore, there is no sign of thrombosis. Discontinuing aspirin is not necessary because there are no clinical signs of bleeding. There is no indication for transfusing platelets in this patient. The diagnosis of HIT is difficult in patients who undergo CPB; efforts have been made to identify simple criteria for HIT diagnosis. A score was developed to aid in diagnosis, which was derived from a retrospective review of 84 patients undergoing CPB. The elements of the score were the pattern of thrombocytopenia (biphasic versus linear drop in platelet count), the length of time of CPB greater than or equal to 118 min, and an interval of greater than or equal to five days. The score had a 97% negative predictive value for excluding an HIT diagnosis. HIT is important to diagnose in cardiac surgery patients because it has been associated with a 50% increase in mortality and a significant increase in morbidity. References: 1.

        "correct_answer": "B",
        "rationale": "This parturient had a witnessed ventricular fibrillation (VF) arrest. Similar to any cardiac arrest, it is important to consider the etiology. Possible etiologies of VF arrest include coronary artery disease, ischemic and non-ischemic cardiomyopathies, valvular lesions, pulmonary embolus, aortic dissection, and electrophysiologic abnormalities. Additional etiologies relevant to pregnancy should also be considered. Normal physiologic changes of pregnancy must be considered when resuscitating a pregnant patient. These include possible difficult airway due to pharyngeal edema and enlarged breast tissue; increased risk of aspiration due to relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter; decreased chest wall compliance due to enlarged breasts; decreased functional residual capacity due to upward displacement of the diaphragm by the gravid uterus; increased oxygen consumption due to the developing fetus; upward displacement of the heart due to the gravid uterus; sequestration of up to 30% of circulating blood volume in the second half of pregnancy due to compression of the inferior vena cava, iliac vessels, and abdominal aorta by the gravid uterus; decreased effect of chest compressions due to decreased venous return leading to supine hypotension; and obstruction of forward blood flow by the gravid uterus. In general, resuscitative algorithms are the same for pregnant as for non-pregnant patients, with one exception: rather than placing the patient in the left lateral position (at least 15\u00b0 tilt), manually displacing the uterus to the left of the abdomen to relieve aortocaval compression is better for venous return to the heart. If she has been receiving a magnesium infusion, it should be stopped, and calcium administered. Additionally, a maternal cardiopulmonary arrest team should be in place, consisting of the usual adult resuscitation team, an obstetrician, obstetric anesthesiologist, obstetric nurse, and the neonatology team. If there is no return of spontaneous circulation after four minutes of resuscitative efforts in a patient with an obviously gravid uterus, emergency cesarean section should be considered, with the aim of delivering the fetus within five minutes of cardiac arrest onset. An obviously gravid uterus is one that is deemed to be sufficiently large to cause aortocaval compression. Delivery of the fetus and placenta improves venous return and cardiac output, facilitating closed chest compressions, reducing oxygen consumption, and making ventilation easier; it can also allow internal cardiac massage by heart compression (with the diaphragm still intact) against the anterior chest wall. After 15 minutes of unsuccessful closed chest cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), direct cardiac massage via thoracotomy or through the diaphragm (if the abdomen is open) can be implemented. This would not be done before an emergency cesarean section in this case. Direct cardiac massage results in near-normal systemic perfusion throughout the compression cycle and with higher cranial and myocardial flow than that achieved with external chest compressions of conventional CPR. Successful use of cardiopulmonary bypass in maternal resuscitation has been described in case reports of women with circulatory collapse due to amniotic fluid embolism and pulmonary embolism. However, use of this technology requires a specialized team and preparation time; cesarean delivery should not be delayed in this case. Overdrive pacing is not indicated for VF, even when the rhythm has deteriorated to asystole, because the hypoxic human heart will not respond to pacing with mechanical contractions. Although the use of pacing for patients with asystole lacks evidence, it may be useful when the asystole is caused by a primary conduction system problem and ventricular standstill is noted quickly on the monitor, when standstill is drug induced, in cases of reflex vagal standstill, and when asystole follows defibrillation.

Risk factors include maternal age 35 years or older, cesarean delivery, forceps-assisted and vacuum-assisted vaginal deliveries, placenta previa, abruption placenta, eclampsia, and fetal distress. The classic presentation of AFE is characterized by sudden cardiovascular collapse, with profound systemic hypotension, cardiac dysrhythmia, cyanosis, dyspnea or respiratory arrest, pulmonary edema or adult respiratory distress syndrome, altered mental status, and hemorrhage from disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Seizures are also possible. Many patients progress to multiorgan failure. The hemodynamic response to AFE seems to be biphasic, based on transesophageal echocardiography studies, with initial pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular failure, followed later by left ventricular failure, most likely caused by the dilated right ventricle (RV) interfering with left-sided filling, but also possibly caused by direct myocardial depression by amniotic fluid or other immune modulators, or by ischemic injury to myocardium. Hypoxemia results from ventilation/perfusion mismatching caused by severe pulmonary vasoconstriction. There is no consensus as to the exact pathophysiology of the syndrome, nor are there strict diagnostic criteria. AFE is thought to result from an immune-mediated mechanism, given its similarity to septic shock or anaphylactic shock. It may result from an abnormal immunologic response of the mother following exposure to fetal antigens, leading to the release of various proinflammatory mediators. AFE remains a diagnosis of exclusion. Management is largely supportive. The presentation of AFE may mimic pulmonary embolus, sepsis, hemorrhage and DIC from other causes, or anaphylaxis. Cornerstones of management include securing the airway and providing mechanical ventilation, as well as supporting circulation with pressors and inotropes. Full laboratory evaluation should be undertaken, including arterial blood gases, chemistry, complete blood count, and coagulation studies. Transesophageal echocardiography, arterial blood pressure monitoring, and pulmonary artery catheters may be useful. Blood product administration is usually necessary. Specific therapies targeted at pulmonary hypertension and RV failure have proved helpful; these include inodilators such as milrinone and dobutamine, as well as selective pulmonary vasodilators such as nitric oxide. Intra-aortic balloon pump and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation have also been used. Emergent cesarean section should also be considered to improve resuscitative efforts in the mother. Uterine rupture usually presents with decline in fetal heart rate, abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding, loss of fetal station on vaginal examination and, later, hypovolemic shock. A patient with intravascular injection of local anesthetic would have signs of central nervous system toxicity (lightheadedness, visual or auditory disturbances, muscle twitching, seizure, and coma) and, at very high concentrations, cardiovascular collapse. If she had progressed to eclampsia, she would have presented with seizure. References: 1. Conde-Agudelo A, Romero R. Amniotic fluid embolism: an evidence-based review.

        "rationale": "This multisystem trauma patient is in acute circulatory shock. Trauma patients should receive an organized and rapid team-based resuscitation that follows Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) or Anesthesia Trauma and Critical Care (ATACC) guidelines. Both of these focus on rapid assessment and immediate stabilization of airway, breathing, and circulation. The patient has been successfully intubated, and resuscitation with crystalloids and, ideally, blood products has begun. Clinical assessment, radiography, and ultrasound can be used to rapidly diagnosis the cause of acute circulatory shock. Hypovolemic shock from acute blood loss is the most common cause, but obstructive (tension pneumothorax, cardiac tamponade), cardiogenic (blunt cardiac injury), and distributive shock (neurogenic) can also occur. An extended focused assessment with sonography in trauma (eFAST) examination can help the clinician rapidly diagnosis tension pneumothorax, pericardial tamponade, and intraperitoneal free fluid, which probably means intra-abdominal bleeding in this clinical situation. The patient is hypotensive after initial resuscitation. She has a positive FAST examination and is hypotensive; therefore, she needs to undergo an exploratory laparotomy. Standard triple-lumen catheters are useful for administering multiple different medications at once as well as vasopressors. Their length and relatively narrow internal diameter do not facilitate rapid flow. A diagnostic peritoneal lavage is unnecessary in the setting of a positive FAST examination in this hemodynamically unstable blunt trauma patient. A major concern is delayed treatment of other life-threatening injuries. Although the diagnostic utility of CT is important, it should not delay definitive treatment. Delaying control of lifethreatening bleeding can prove fatal. Management of neurotrauma focuses on preserving cerebral perfusion pressure, which equals mean arterial pressure minus intracranial pressure. Hemorrhage and hypotension should be managed before diagnosis of potential intracranial injuries. Empiric placement of an intracranial monitor is controversial at best in an under-resuscitated patient. Either way it should not delay laparotomy. References: 1. Emergency Medicine Updates.

Unlike the metabolite of morphine, morphine-6-glucuronide, hydromorphone-6- glucuronide has no analgesic properties. Cisatracurium is a nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent that is commonly used in ICUs. It is degraded by Hofmann elimination, which depends on pH and temperature but not organ function. Therefore, the cisatracurium dose does not require adjustment for patients with renal or liver insufficiency. Cisatracurium has no metabolites.

A number of antibiotics have been associated with neurologic symptoms, including penicillins, cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, tetracyclines, sulfonamides, and metronidazole. Risk factors for antibiotic-associated neurotoxicity include older age, critical illness, renal dysfunction, and prior neurologic disease. For this patient, cefepime toxicity is the most likely etiology of his neurologic deterioration. Cefepime is a fourth-generation cephalosporin bactericidal for a broad spectrum of organisms, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Cefepime is predominantly renally excreted (85% unchanged) and, in patients with renal failure, it can accumulate in both blood and cerebrospinal fluid, and can reach toxic concentrations. This most commonly occurs when standard dose adjustments of cefepime for renal function are not made, but can also occur despite dose adjustment. The latency between the start of cefepime treatment and the development of neurologic manifestations has been reported to occur in as little as one day. A wide variety of manifestations have been reported from cefepime-induced neurotoxicity, including confusion, hallucinations, agitation, myoclonic jerks, seizures, delirium, and coma. It has also been reported to cause nonconvulsive status epilepticus, a disorder characterized by alteration of consciousness without convulsions. On EEG, periodic sharp waves and triphasic waves are characteristic. If cefepime-induced neurotoxicity is suspected, cefepime should be discontinued in favor of an alternative antibiotic. Cefepime is dialyzable, and up to 70% of a dose may be removed by a three-hour hemodialysis session. Benzodiazepines or other anti-seizure medications should be used to treat seizure activity. Neurologic symptoms typically regress within two to seven days after stopping cefepime. The pathogenesis of cefepime neurotoxicity has not been fully elucidated. Penicillins and cephalosporins are believed to exert an inhibitory effect on gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transmission via their \u00df-lactam ring structure, which shares similar structural features to those of GABA neurotransmitters. In renally impaired patients, neurotoxicity appears to be mediated by a rise in serum cefepime concentrations and increased permeability of the blood-brain barrier secondary to uremia. References: 1.

        "rationale": "In a patient with a polysubstance overdose, identifying the specific agent responsible for toxicity is crucial because specific therapies may be indicated. All patients with known or suspected overdose should have an ECG on admission. Tricyclic antidepressants generally cause prolongation of several intervals, including the corrected QT (QTc) and the QRS; these effects are largely secondary to blocking effects on cardiac sodium channels. Left untreated, these abnormalities can progress to fatal ventricular dysrhythmias. Hypotension results from a combination of reduced myocardial contractility and decreased systemic vascular resistance due to alphaadrenergic blockage. Sodium bicarbonate is indicated in this situation; repeat boluses should be administered until normalization of the QRS interval is observed. Naloxone is used to reverse opiate toxicity, which generally does not cause ECG abnormalities. Flumazenil is contraindicated because patients with any sodium channel blocking agent, including tricyclic antidepressants, is at high risk for seizures. Cyproheptadine may be administered to patients with serotonin syndrome, which generally presents with fever, and is probably not part of this clinical scenario.

The more recently approved lipoglycopeptide antibiotics, dalbavancin and oritavancin, also demonstrate in vitro activity to vancomycinintermediate Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Oritavancin, as opposed to dalbavancin, falsely elevates the activated partial thromboplastin time for 48 hours and the prothrombin time/INR for 24 hours, thus making titration of heparin and warfarin dosing unreliable. It does this by binding and activating the phospholipid reagents used in these assays. Also, oritavancin results in enhanced exposure to warfarin when dosed in overlap. As such, it is recommended that treatment with heparin be avoided in the initial 48 hours after dosing with oritavancin, and that treatment with oritavancin be very carefully weighed in patients on warfarin.

Which of the following is the most likely cause of her altered mental status?",
        "correct_answer": "A",
        "rationale": "3, 4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is an amphetamine derivative that has been said to cause euphoria and decrease inhibitions. Side effects include dry mouth, bruxism, jaw clenching, anxiety, panic attacks, tachycardia, hypertension, hyperthermia, and excessive thirst. More severe side effects include serotonin syndrome, rhabdomyolysis, subarachnoid hemorrhage, fulminant hepatic failure, coma, and severe hyponatremia, which can be associated with seizures. The risk of death from first use of MDMA has been estimated between 1 in 20,000 and 1 in 50,000. The cause of hyponatremia from MDMA is thought to be due to a combination of syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone with excessive water intake. The increased antidiuretic hormone leads to increased free water reabsorption, lowering the serum sodium level. This is then compounded by the increased water intake from the sensation of excess thirst that MDMA causes, dropping the sodium level further. There is also salt loss from excessive sweating caused by increased physical activity. The acute hyponatremia leads to cerebral edema and can cause seizures, as in this patient. Heroin, also known as diacetylmorphine, is a narcotic with a very high addictive potential. Signs of heroin overdose include altered mental status, respiratory depression, and miotic pupils. Heroin overdose is most commonly associated with IV route of administration. Respiratory depression can lead to cardiorespiratory arrest and death. Naloxone is used to reverse the effects of heroin. In this patient with altered mental status, the normal respiratory rate, dilated pupils, lack of injection marks, and negative urine toxicology screen argue against heroin overdose. (Of note, many IV drug users use inconspicuous sites, so not finding injections sites does not exclude injection use.) Hyponatremia is not typically associated with heroin overdose. Potomania is ethanol poisoning from massive intakes of alcohol. It can lead to hyponatremia. This patient\u2019s alcohol level is elevated, indicating alcohol consumption, but not to a high enough level to cause this degree of hyponatremia. Acute bacterial meningitis can cause altered mental status in a patient with fever. The lack of a history of illness and the time course of her illness make the diagnosis less likely. On examination, the clinician would look for photophobia and neck stiffness. Pupillary response can range from sluggish to dilated, and is nonspecific. While hyponatremia can occur, it is usually not this severe. The normal white blood cell count also argues against infection. In this patient, it would not have been unreasonable to perform a lumbar puncture to exclude acute bacterial meningitis, but the lack of other findings suggestive of meningitis makes it a less likely diagnosis.

Medical history is significant for diabetes mellitus complicated by intermittent nausea and gastroparesis, for which she takes metoclopramide (last dose two days ago); depression, for which she takes amitriptyline; and a recent upper respiratory tract infection, for which she has been taking scheduled over-the-counter cough medicine for the past week including the morning of surgery. She also reports an allergic-type reaction to penicillin as a child, with hives and shortness of breath. She is induced with fentanyl, lidocaine, propofol, and succinylcholine. An endotracheal tube is easily inserted and the case proceeds without difficulty. Vancomycin, 1 g, is given as antibiotic prophylaxis because of her allergy to penicillin. Methylene blue, 100 mg, is given toward the end of the case to confirm that no violation of the upper urinary tract system took place.

She is emergently intubated.

Which of the following diagnoses is most likely?",
        "correct_answer": "D",
        "rationale": "Methylene blue is a known monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI). It is a potent reversible inhibitor of MAO A and, at concentrations reported in the literature after IV administration, MAO B would be partially inhibited but MAO A would be completely inhibited. This inhibition of MAO A can lead to disturbances in 5-hydroxytryptamine (5- HT) (serotonin) metabolism, leading to serotonin toxicity (formerly called serotonin syndrome). The patient reported taking scheduled dextromethorphan for a week before surgery. The dextromethorphan-MAOI interaction appears to be due to 5-HT potentiation. In cat studies, dextromethorphan has been shown to markedly enhance the response of noradrenaline and 5-HT but to antagonize the effects of tyramine. This suggests that it blocks the uptake of these amines in the adrenergic nerve endings. Serotonin toxicity is characterized by increased heart rate, shivering, sweating, dilated pupils, myoclonus (usually more prominent in the lower extremities), hyperreflexia, hyperthermia, hypertension, and agitation. Hyperthermia can lead to rhabdomyolysis and renal failure. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome usually involves muscle cramps and tremors (not myoclonus), fevers and symptoms of autonomic nervous system instability such as unstable blood pressure, as well as altered mental status. These symptoms are most likely caused by blockade of the dopamine receptor D2, leading to abnormal function of the basal ganglia similar to Parkinson disease. Symptoms generally come on quickly after the initiation of dopamine antagonists and peak at around three days. This patient was taking metoclopramide (a dopamine D2 antagonist) intermittently for nausea and gastroparesis, but had not taken any the morning of surgery. The half-life of metoclopramide is five to six hours; therefore, this is a much less likely cause of her symptoms. She takes amitriptyline for depression. Amitriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant, which can cause vasodilation, dry mouth, urinary retention, tachycardia, hypotension, and altered mental status, symptoms likely due to the anticholinergic effects of tricyclic antidepressants. The treatment is physostigmine. She had been taking amitriptyline before surgery. There is no reason to believe that she had recently overdosed on it. Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is induced by succinylcholine, but is an autosomal dominant disease process characterized by a mutation in the ryanodine receptor on the sarcoplasmic reticulum in skeletal muscle cells, which release calcium in response to increased levels of intracellular calcium, leading to muscle contraction. In MH, there is an excessive release of sarcoplasmic reticular calcium leading to prolonged muscle contraction. Symptoms of MH include high temperature, increased heart rate, tachypnea, increased carbon dioxide production, increased oxygen consumption, mixed acidosis, rigid muscles, and rhabdomyolysis. The first evidence of MH is usually a rise in end-tidal carbon dioxide. In this patient, a pure respiratory acidosis is present. References: 1. Ramsay RR, Dunford C, Gillman PK.

        "correct_answer": "A",
        "rationale": "Acetaminophen (also called paracetamol) is the most widely used analgesic and antipyretic worldwide. Its side effects are generally mild with recommended doses; its use has steadily increased because of its safety profile compared to nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. The IV preparation of acetaminophen offers the ability to achieve therapeutic blood concentrations more readily and more reliably, which may be particularly beneficial for use in critically ill patients. However, emerging clinical data suggest that IV paracetamol has a propensity to cause hypotension in critically ill patients. One of the first studies, by de Maat et al, specifically examined the hemodynamic effects of the new ready-to-use formulation of IV paracetamol. It found a decrease in systolic blood pressure of at least 10 mm Hg within 30 minutes of IV administration in one-third of patients. Postulated mechanisms for the hypotension include paracetamol-induced increases in skin blood flow (consistent with its antipyretic action) and the effects of mannitol, which is used as a stabilizing agent in the IV formulation. Other adverse effects with therapeutic acetaminophen use are rare. It can cause transient abnormalities of liver function. Very rarely, blood disorders, including druginduced immune thrombocytopenia, have been reported. Pyroglutamic acidosis is a rare adverse effect associated with therapeutic acetaminophen use, most frequently identified in malnourished female patients who have renal insufficiency or failure. Acute allergic reactions to acetaminophen are very rarely described. Meta-analyses have demonstrated that the addition of acetaminophen to morphine reduces morphine requirements in postsurgical patients by about 20%. As a result, acetaminophen is commonly administered along with opioids as part of a strategy of multimodal analgesia. References: 1. Boyle M, Nicholson L, O\u2019Brien M, et al.

Appropriate firstline therapy remains glucagon and calcium, but in extreme circumstances, high-dose insulin has been shown to be effective. However, in the setting of prolonged hypotension, vasopressor support is indicated, with seeming equipoise between epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine. Vasopressin also appears to show some benefit, and sometimes multiple vasopressors are required. Because of primary distributive shock, venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation has limited utility. Insulin is acting as a chronotrope and inotrope, and is therefore giving him vital hemodynamic support. While atenolol primarily does not bind protein in the body, verapamil does exist in the body as a protein-bound drug (about 75%).

Laboratory studies reveal a pure anion gap acidosis, with an anion gap of 38, an osmolar gap of 6 mOsm/kg, a creatinine of 2.2 mg/dL, and a pH of 6.95. Which of the following is a principle that should guide this patient\u2019s management?",
        "correct_answer": "D",
        "rationale": "In a patient with a presentation such as this, with no hard findings of a toxidrome other than depressed mental status, and a very high anion gap, toxic alcohol ingestion must be suspected. In this case, the patient drank antifreeze, leading to an ethylene glycol overdose. Ethylene glycol is metabolized by alcohol dehydrogenase to glycolic and oxalic acid; methanol is metabolized to formic acid. The osmolar gap is useful in diagnosing these ingestions, but not foolproof. As the alcohol is metabolized, the osmolar gap narrows and the anion gap increases. In this patient, with an anion gap of 38 and a pH of 6.95, significant metabolism has occurred, which accounts for his critically ill state and lack of osmolar gap. Also, treatment with ethanol or fomepizole (a competitive inhibitor of alcohol dehydrogenase) will not remove the toxic metabolites, but will aid in the prevention of further accumulation/metabolism of more metabolites. This patient needs emergent hemodialysis to correct his life-threatening acidosis, and remove toxic metabolites. In addition, adjunctive therapy would include fomepizole until ethylene glycol levels are undetectable, sodium bicarbonate (before dialysis is initiated at least) to enhance formate and oxalate elimination by ion trapping, as well as thiamine and pyridoxine supplementation. Another toxic alcohol to consider is isopropyl alcohol, which is found in rubbing alcohol. This is metabolized to acetone, which is eliminated in the urine. In contrast to ethylene glycol and methanol, isopropyl alcohol will not cause a metabolic acidosis, but has been known to cause nausea, vomiting, and gastrointestinal bleeding, in addition to severe intoxication.

        "prompt": "A 28-year-old man sustained severe brain injury from hypoxia-ischemia after cardiac arrest due to hypoxic respiratory failure in the setting of a heroin overdose. He undergoes a trial of targeted temperature management (TTM) to hypothermia (core temperature of 33\u00b0C [91.4\u00b0F]) in the ICU; shivering is managed with infusions of fentanyl, meperidine, midazolam, and cisatracurium. After 24 hours, he is re-warmed to a core temperature of 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F). His renal and liver functions are deteriorating. On day two, the family requests a formal evaluation for prognosis and determination of neurologic function. His vital signs are: blood pressure 148/98 mm Hg, heart rate 78 beats/min, respiratory rate 16 breaths/min per ventilator and oxygen saturation 98% (fraction of inspired oxygen 0.5, positive end-expiratory pressure 8 cmH20). On examination, he is comatose, with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 3. No motor responses are seen. Corneal, pupillary, oculocephalic, cold caloric, gag, and cough reflexes are absent. Sodium is 148mEq/L, blood urea nitrogen 108 mg/dL, creatinine is 4.2 mg/dL, bicarbonate is 18 mEq/L, aspartate aminotransferase is 2818 IU, and alanine aminotransferase is 3245 IU.

        "correct_answer": "C",
        "rationale": "The clinical examination in brain death is the most unequivocal in neurology. It should be performed with care and accuracy. In the era of hypothermia, evidence suggests that the best approach before providing prognostic information is to wait for a period of 72 hours after rewarming. This is particularly important if the patient has been exposed to sedatives and paralytics in the setting of organ dysfunction, which could confound the clinical examination. The American Academy of Neurology practice parameter recommends excluding the presence of a central nervous system (CNS)- depressant drug effect by history, drug screen, calculation of clearance using five times the drug\u2019s half-life (assuming normal hepatic and renal function) or, if available, drug plasma levels below the therapeutic range. Prior use of hypothermia (after cardiopulmonary resuscitation for cardiac arrest) may also delay drug metabolism. If these two circumstances are present, then longer periods of observation may be needed. EEG could be misleading in patients with lingering effects of CNS depressants. Neuron-specific enolase is not diagnostic for brain death but could provide prognostic information when used with other variables such as the clinical examination. A flow scan would help in the determination of brain death if the physician cannot accurately assess neurologic function after a reasonable period of observation, but it may be premature in this case.

A case-control study is a type of observational study in which two existing groups differing in outcome are identified and compared on the basis of some supposed causal attribute or exposure. Controls are selected independent of exposure. When the selection occurs on the basis of one characteristic, it is considered a matched study. An ecological study is an observational study in which at least one variable is measured at the group level. A randomized controlled clinical trial is superior methodology in the hierarchy of evidence in therapy, because it limits the potential for any biases by randomly assigning one patient pool to an intervention and another patient pool to nonintervention or placebo.

This project comprised 85% of Michigan\u2019s ICU beds. A follow-up analysis at three years demonstrated a sustained improvement. A central line bundle incorporated five Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations: hand washing, using full-barrier precautions during the insertion of central venous catheters, cleaning the skin with chlorhexidine, avoiding the femoral site if possible, and removing unnecessary catheters. A large randomized trial showed that subclavian placement decreased the rate of infection, but is associated with more pneumothoraces. No data supports the changing of central lines every seven days or daily blood cultures. Multidisciplinary rounds are important in the ICU, but rounding without addressing the need for central lines has not proven to decrease CLABSIs. References: 1.

        "rationale": "In 2008, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services created incentives for hospitals to prevent pressure ulcers; however, they remain frequent events in ICUs. The exact incidence is unclear because of a lack of identification of ulcers on patient admission to the ICU and variations in data reporting. The incidence has been reported to vary between 3% and 20%. Mechanical ventilation has been associated with an increased incidence of pressure ulcers, secondary to patients being sedentary, and noninvasive ventilation has also been implicated. Both intermittent and continuous dialysis have been associated with an increased incidence of pressure ulcers, but surgery lasting longer than two hours has not been associated with it. Surgery lasting longer than four hours has been associated with it. It is important to identify patients at risk and to develop strategies to prevent pressure ulcers in critically ill patients. The Critical Care Pressure Ulcer Assessment Tool Made Easy (CALCULATE) score was developed through literature review and refined through clinical implementation. The score consists of risk factors identified through the medical literature for pressure ulcers, including: too unstable to turn, low protein, dialysis, fecal incontenience, mechanical ventilation, long surgery/cardiac arrest during admission, and impaired circulation. The score was used over a four-month period, and impaired mobility was added as another risk factor. The two most commonly used scales in the United States are the Braden Scale and the Norton Scale. Preventing pressure ulcers is important because they increase mortality, morbidity, pain, and hospital costs. A multitude of preventive measures exist, but a focused program that ensures excellent communication between leadership and staff seems most vital in decreasing pressure ulcers. References: 1.
